""if we sell the best quality and the cheapest products,everyone will buy them,"" mhi president yotaro iida said.    although two of mhis main businesses, shipbuilding andpower plant construction, have been hit hard by the yens 40pct rise against the dollar, the company has no plans toabandon them, iida told reuters in an interview.    its other big activity, aircraft component manufacture, hasperformed so well that mhi now accounts for half of the moneytokyo spends on defence procurement each year.    ""we have made the utmost efforts among the worldsmanufacturers to improve productivity,"" he said. ""you may besurprised if you come to see our plants. the outside is old butthe inside is ultra-modern, with robots and computers.""    securities analysts at major securities houses agreed thatmhi has pared costs more quickly than its competitors. thecompany has slashed its workforce to 47,000 from 86,000 in1976.    despite its cost-cutting, mhi expects profits to drop 40pct to 30 billion yen in the current fiscal year ending march31, from 1985/86s record 50.14 billion.    and that includes gains from the sale of mhis stake inmitsubishi motors corp <mimt.t> for 49 billion yen.    iida is optimistic about the future, however. he said aresurgence of demand from the middle east following the recentrecovery in oil prices coupled with persistent demand for powerplants in developing countries will help mhi restore itsexports-to-sales ratio to the past decades average of 30 pct.    mhis exports-to-sales ratio fell to 25.9 pct in thehalf-year ended last september, from 35 to 36 pct five yearsago.    china is the most promising market, although mhi alsoconsiders other non-oil-producing developing countries as majorcustomers.    ""our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to alack of foreign currency,"" iida said. but he added that he feltmhi could sell to those markets with japanese governmentfinancial support.    it can also finance the plants itself and recover itsinvestment through product sales, a strategy iida said couldprove popular in the future.    in shipping, mhi is fighting back against low-priced southkorean competition by building more technologically advancedcarriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other productsdifficult to transport.    shipbuilders association officials told reuters mhi is theworlds largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity.    domestically, mhi is involved in 12 national projects,including development of nuclear fusion reactors and launchvehicles for man-made satellites.    it has been the biggest contractor for the japan defenceagencys f-15 and f-14 jet fighters and missiles, although allof these have been built under licence from u.s. firms.    mhi is now heading up five japanese companies seeking todevelop the countrys own fighter plane to replace thecurrently used f-1 support fighters in the late 1990s.    military experts said washington is putting strong pressureon tokyo to buy a u.s. plane, either the mcdonnell douglas corpf-18 or general dynamics corp f-16, to reduce japans hugetrade surplus with the u.s.    ""it might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with u.s.makers as japan is supported by the u.s. defence umbrella,"" iidasaid.    mhi also plans to cooperate with the u.s. in its strategicdefence initiative space defence program by participating inthe project when it moves from the research stage, he said.    the u.s. has been seeking japans technological support.    in fiscal 1985/86, aircraft accounted for 17.1 pct of mhissales, shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 27.9 pct. iida saidthe ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct, aircraft and specialvehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct.    as for the remaining 30 pct, iida said he wanted to shiftthe domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold tomanufacturers and towards household goods, but he declined tospecify which products.

""but as long as brazil sticks to its hardline position, wecan never bridge the gap,"" dharyono said.    indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries,along with costa rica, the dominican republic, ecuador,honduras, india, papua new guinea and peru, which proposed anew quota system at last months failed international coffeeorganistion (ico) talks in london.    brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under thegroup of eight scheme, blocked the proposal.    aice officials are now hoping colombia can use its contactswith brazil to suggest a compromise.    edward muda, an aice official who attended the iconegotiations, said latin american members of the group of eightwere in contact with colombia, the worlds second largestproducer, but gave no details.    ""colombia has shown interest because they will gain from acompromise. without one, they will suffer if the present marketstays like it is,"" muda said.    he said indonesia was in contact with consumers such as theu.s., japan, the netherlands, west germany and canada ahead ofan ico executive board meeting scheduled for april 1.    dharyono said the aice will send delegations to the u.s.and japan to brief indonesian embassy officials there and pressthem to present indonesias case more firmly.    he urged the indonesian government to do more to help thecountrys coffee traders through the ico negotiations.    muda said the group of eight had some common ground withthe big consumers because they agreed on the need for basingquotas on what he termed ""realistic criteria.""    the breakaway group believes the old quota system, whichgives brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does notreflect up-to-date supply and demand trends.    brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the oldsystem be applied.    export quotas were suspended in february 1986 when marketprices surged because of the failure of the brazilian crop.    although prices have long since come down to a point whereexport controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumersat the 75-member ico have not been able to agree on newguidelines. brazil and the u.s., the largest consumer, are bothrefusing to alter their positions.    dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believedindonesia was well placed to survive low prices.    indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and theaice is improving its marketing system, dharyono said.    indonesias coffee output in 1986/87, ending september 30,is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last years levelof 360,000 tonnes, he said.    he said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average forthe time of year. reuter"

4267,coffee,"no near term brazil coffee moves expectedthe brazilian coffee institute,ibc, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until theend of next week at the earliest, trade sources said.    ibc president jorio dauster is meeting governmentministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assessbrazils position in the light of the failure of talks inlondon earlier this month to set new international coffeeorganization, ico, export quotas.    ""the failure of the talks means brazil has got to rethinkits position completely,"" one santos exporter said.    a meeting of the national coffee policy council is set forthursday, march 19, and dauster will almost certainly explainhis plan to members then before announcing any new measures.    dauster told reporters on his return from london last weekthat no decisions would be made on exports before he had heldtalks with all sectors of the industry.    exporters said dauster is not under any great pressure tostart marketing coffee immediately. world prices have beenrecovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the icotalks and brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilosfor export in the first four months of this year.    the exporters said the key factor in the eventual openingof may and june export registrations will be the amount atwhich the contribution quota is set.    with little expectation of other sales incentive mechanismssuch as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees beingintroduced, the level of the quota will be decisive indetermining the competitiveness of brazilian coffee on worldmarkets, they said.    they noted that on february 16, the eve of a plannedincrease in the quota, april registrations were opened andclosed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a recordamount for a single day.    if may/june registrations are opened under similarconditions as before, brazil would have no difficulty inselling at least 2.0 mln bags per month.    ""the problem would be how to limit sales,"" one exporter said.    brazils present foreign trade and payments problems meanthere are pressures from the government to boost exports tomaximise foreign exchange earnings.    however, the sources said they expect the ibc to adopt amarketing strategy aimed at regaining brazils dominantposition as an exporter, but without causing a price war.    general opinion among exporters was that brazil would planto export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ico.    the 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be aroundthe figure brazil had offered to ship if ico quotas werereintroduced, although dauster has said this offer expired withthe breakdown of talks.    with the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags thisyear, brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags aftermeeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added.    however, the sources said brazil is unlikely even toconsider exporting such quantities, as this would almostinevitably lead to a fall in world prices as brazil tried toencroach on other producers markets.    maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderlymarketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing brazilsmarket share after last years unusually low exports of 9.9 mlnbags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordialrelations with the producer group which backed brazils stanceat the ico talks, they added. reuter"

4470,cocoa,"pessimism mounts over bahian temporao cocoa croppessimism over the effects of aprolonged dry spell on the coming bahian temporao cocoa crop isrising with trade forecasts generally in the 2.0 mln to 2.5 mlnbag range against 2.5 mln to 3.0 mln a fortnight ago.    trade sources told reuters from the state capital ofsalvador that despite scattered rains since mid-february, whichbroke a six week drought, plantations have not picked up ashoped and very little cocoa is expected to be gathered in thefirst three months of the may/september crop.    the sources said arrivals from may through july might onlyreach around 600,000 bags whereas in normal years a figure of1.0 mln to 1.5 mln bags might be expected.    arrivals from then should start to pick up sharply as podsfrom current flowering are gathered. however, the sources noteda late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, whichflourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is morelikely from late july on.    this years crop is doubly susceptible because poor pricesmean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers andinsecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot.    a severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said.    because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage,estimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremelyvulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0mln bag mark if the disease hits.    although flowering was good following the start of therains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly becausethe drought had caused a drop in the insect population whichpollinates flowers, the sources said.    however, reports from farms indicate moisture levels arenow generally back to near normal levels and that currentflowering and pod setting is good, which should result inmature fruit from august through september.    the sources said they expect no break in the harvesting ofbeans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of themain crop, which officially starts on october 1.    ""the cut-off date is completely artificial. if things gowell from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a breakfrom august through november or even december,"" one said.    if predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao proveaccurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for thepast 10 years. the last poor temporao was in 1984 whenprolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mlnbags, the lowest since 1974.    good growing conditions the following year produced atemporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bagrecord, while last years output, which also suffered somedrought damage, was 2.77 mln bags.    figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwardsby the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans.    the sources said large quantities of beans are believed tohave been undeclared from this years record total harvest andthey were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by theend of the official crop year on april 30.    recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by theinclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to portwarehouses but not declared.    because of the high turnover of beans this year,significant amounts have deteriorated because they were storedtoo long at the back of warehouses. some of these are expectedto be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals.    with official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao andmain crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeksstill to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should beat least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared,the sources said.    this would compare with the previous record set last yearof 6.03 mln.    however, there is no way of telling how many current cropbeans will be declared after the may 1 start of the temporaoand thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never beofficially registered. reuter"

4603,coffee,"colombia's coffee marketing to be more flexiblecolombia intends to improve themarketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility onsetting export registration prices, finance minister cesargaviria said.    speaking to reporters after announcing a lower exportregistration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-docknew york, gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile.    ""in the first stage, we decided not only to lower thereintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro thatwill allow private exporters to participate more actively incolombias coffee export policy,"" he said.    traders said this means the export registration price willchange more often in a truer reflection of market trends.    gaviria said the measures merely responded to new marketfactors since a return to a system of international coffeeorganisation (ico) export quotas may not occur in the shortterm.    ico talks last month in london failed to break a deadlockover re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in february1986.    gaviria stressed that colombia will not necessarily sufferfrom depressed prices because it can compensate lower priceswith increased volume.    ""colombia will continue to export its traditional amount ofcoffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will doso without an agreement among producers,"" he said.    he ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5mln bags as mentioned in market circles, ""because the idea isprecisely not to disrupt the market.""    colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86coffee year which ended last september 30.    echoing gavirias words, jorge cardenas, manager of thenational coffee growers federation, said colombia sought toadapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances.    ""there is great expectation in the world for the policiesthat brazil and colombia will adopt. ours is beginning toemerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in theimmediate future,"" he told journalists.    trade sources in rio today said brazils future exportpolicy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week.    cardenas said a new ico meeting could only take place whenproblems that hindered an agreement at the recent london talkshave been resolved.    asked to comment on a reuter report from jakarta sayingindonesia hoped colombia could use its contacts with brazil tosuggest a compromise on the quota issue, cardenas said thebrazilian stand was quite clear.    he said brazils current quota ""reflects the reality of themarket, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand,"" butadded more clarity was needed to assess the criteria thatdetermined it.    cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failureof the london talks were triggered by a widespread fear amongdealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producerswould go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible,which did not happen. reuter"
4630,sugar,"china faces dilemma over sugar importschina has to decide if it will increasesugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output andrising demand, in view of market predictions that internationalsugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and theofficial press said.    he kang, minister of agriculture, animal husbandry andfisheries, said this week that china has adjusted thepurchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop inproduction last year but he gave no price details.    one japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidlybecause of improving living standards and rising demand forsweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods.    ""it will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in astate-controlled economy. china may have to import,"" he said.    customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes injanuary 1987 from 54,000 in january 1986.    the official economic information newspaper last month saidproduction in the 1986/87 crushing season (september-april)will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand.    the paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes.    ""in the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beethas fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has droppedand cannot meet demand that is rising every day,"" it said.    ""the country will have to continue imports of sugar and drawdown stocks to meet market demand,"" it added.    it quoted the ministry of light industry as blaming thedrop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for caneand beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmersrefusing to grow them.    the paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to threetimes more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up toseven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. he couldsell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane.    sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices havenot changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said.    in fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuanin 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills profit to 117yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added.    the paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losingmoney. china has 521 sugar mills.    a foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in caneacreage in 1986/87 (september-august) of up to 10 pct inguangdong, which produced 45 pct of chinas sugar in calendar1985, and a smaller drop in fujian, which produced 11 pct ofchinas sugar in calendar 1985.    he said both provinces are more developed than othersugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities.    but cane acreage in guangxi and yunnan, which accounted for28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87,because cane-growing is more economic there, he said.    he put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in september 1986.    a hong kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mlnat end-january. ""now they are falling but (they) have notreached the critical level, compelling china to import quickly,""he said.    ""china has options not easily available in westerncountries. it controls stocks strictly and can release lessinto the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly,"" he said.    the hong kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will beslightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world pricesand serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, arelikely to continue until at least end-1988.    he said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-ownedmills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers.    ""most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many ofthem using soviet equipment imported in the 1950s,"" he said.    he said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annualfour pct, with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct. reuter"

10306,sugar,"philippine sugar crop set at 1.6 mln tonnesphilippine sugar production in the1987/88 crop year ending august has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes,up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, sugarregulatory administration (sra) chairman arsenio yulo said.    yulo told reuters a survey during the current millingseason, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimatewould almost certainly be met.    he said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop wouldbe earmarked for domestic consumption.    yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for theu.s. sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market.    he said if the government approved a long-standing srarecommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would takeup another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target.    ""the government, for its own reasons, has been delayingapproval of the project, but we expect it to come through byjuly,"" yulo said.    ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oilimport bill by about 300 mln pesos.    yulo said three major philippine distilleries were ready tostart manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved.    the ethanol project would result in employment for about100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work bydepressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry.    production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, hadbeen submitted to president corazon aquino.    ""i think the president would rather wait till the newcongress convenes after the may elections,"" he said. ""but thereis really no need for such quotas. we are right now producingjust slightly over our own consumption level.""    ""the producers have never enjoyed such high prices,"" yulosaid, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesosper picul, up from 190 pesos last august.    yulo said prices were driven up because of speculationfollowing the sras bid to control production.    ""we are no longer concerned so much with the world market,""he said, adding producers in the negros region had learned fromtheir mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming andcloth production.    he said diversification into products other than ethanolwas also possible within the sugar industry.    ""the brazilians long ago learnt their lessons,"" yulo said.""they have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but theyrelocated many of them and diversified production. we want tocall this a sugarcane industry instead of the sugar industry.""    he said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, usedfor thatching roofs, or used in room panelling.    ""when you cut sugarcane you dont even have to producesugar,"" he said.    yulo said the philippines was lobbying for a renewal of theinternational sugar agreement, which expired in 1984.    ""as a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a newagreement which would revive world prices,"" yulo said.    ""if there is no agreement world prices will always bedepressed, particularly because the european community issubsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets.""    he said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60cents per pound, were uneconomical for the philippines, whereproduction costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound.    ""if the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents iexpect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the endof this year,"" he said.    yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by1990, with world consumption outstripping production.    he said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachmentsfrom artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup.    ""but we are not happy with the reagan administration,"" hesaid. ""since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to theu.s. in 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cutours in half without any justification.""    manila was keenly watching washingtons moves to cutdomestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents.    the u.s. agriculture department last december slashed its12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the philippines to143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986.    yulo said despite next years increased production target,some philippine mills were expected to shut down.

10537,cotton,"analysts peg u.s. cotton seedings 10.6 mln acresu.s. cotton farmers are likely toplant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season, based on anaverage of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearingup for the u.s. agriculture departments 1987 plantingintentions report next tuesday.    the annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpseof what u.s. production might be in the 1987/88 season, whichbegins august 1.    trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to10.9 mln acres.    on march 18 of last year, the usda reported that cottonfarmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres.    four months later, the usda estimated that 9.67 mln acreshad been planted as of june 1. by january, its estimate of 1986planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln.    analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in1987 were spurred in part by belief that this years gooddemand and firm prices will be repeated next year. analystssaid those factors make cotton a profitable crop.    ""with cotton more attractive price-wise, i think there isgoing to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton.soybeans are dirt cheap,"" said lisbeth keefe of cargillinvestor services, whose comments were echoed by other cottonmarket specialists.    changes in the u.s. cotton program also could lead toincreased acreage, analysts said.    they recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmerswho used part of their crop as collateral for government loanswere not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton ingovernment warehouses. but under the 1987 plan, the governmentwill not pick up the tab for storage.    analysts said the change will discourage some farmers fromparticipating in the program, which could result in morecotton. ""the cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of25 pct of a farmers base acreage,"" noted judy weissman ofshearson lehman brothers. but farmers who elect not toparticipate in the program are free to plant all the acreage they have.    some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yieldingwestern states would be most likely to steer clear of theprogram. ""western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,"" saidone commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in parton forecasts made by the national cotton council during itsannual meeting in late january.    but others disagreed. ""i think some western growers havedecided they should be in the program for security reasons.theres a lot of comfort in knowing youll be guaranteed thegovernments loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. anyone outside theprogram is subject to the wiles of the market,"" said walterbrown, market analyst for a major california cotton producer.    some cotton specialists said their expectations forincreased acreage might not be verified in tuesdays plantingintentions report. ""anything the usda is announcing now isbased on information they gathered before their cotton programwas announced (on march 20),"" one analyst cautioned. she saidtraders will get a better idea of next years cotton outputwhen the usdas planted acreage report is released on july 9.    brown took that opinion a step further. ""i dont thinkplanted acreage is important. what counts is the abandonmentrate,"" the difference between acreage planted and acreageharvested.    brown said the abandonment rate this year was ""pretty high""at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producingstates. ""more normal would be about six pct,"" he said. reuter"

10593,alum,"new lme aluminium contract welcomed by tradethe london metal exchanges, lme,decision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract,with the port of singapore listed as a delivery point, is apositive move, physical traders and lme dealers said.    earlier this week the lme declared that a 99.70 pct minimumpurity aluminium contract would commence trading on june 1,1987, alongside its long-established sterling-based 99.50 pctcontract.    this is the lmes first dollar contract and non-europeandelivery point, and the board and committee are looking atsingapore as a delivery point for other contracts.    trade sources said the lmes new contract will conform withexisting industry practice, where 99.70 standard re-meltmaterial, priced in dollars, is most commonly traded.    the location of a warehouse in singapore is also a positivemove by the lme, given its ideal location for australian andjapanese traders, who would be able to place metal on towarrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said.    hedging during the lme ring sessions becomes much simplerwith a dollar contract. at present pre-market trading is almostexclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to bedone during the sterling rings, they added.    lme ring dealers said the new contract would match moreclosely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of therecent wide backwardations.    very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pctpurity metal, nearly all of which is produced in eastern bloccountries, such as romania.    the soviet union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declinedas an exporter recently, they said.    some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer fromliquidity problems initially, as business may continue tocentre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, wherethere are many holders of large short positions on the lme.    but others said the new contract would soon attract tradinginterest, given that much 99.70 metal has already beenattracted to the lmes warehouses by backwardations.    the lme also has a much more viable liquidity base for anew contract, compared to the comex market in new york, wherehigh grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, theysaid.    thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract willeventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. likestandard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract,gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the processin this case may take longer, they added.    forming a new contract and establishing a singaporewarehouse are constructive moves by the lme but backwardations,which make physical trading difficult, would not totallydisappear as a result, the trade sources said.    these premiums for prompt metal have become asemi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increasedbusiness and volatility in traded options, and are presentlyaround 50 stg.    increasingly large granting of option positions has beentaking place. when some of these are declared and exercised atthe end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezesaround these dates are commonplace, they said.    listing singapore as a delivery point allows far easternoperators to deliver aluminium into a lme warehouse instead ofhaving to cover.    but tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, eventhough the lmes new option contracts widen the gap between thedeclaration and prompt dates.    these will be due on the first and third wednesday of themonth, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th.    backwardations will remain while operators continue togrant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceedsaluminium stock levels, an lme option trader said. reuter"

""we have established rules which will permit us to withdrawimmediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market,"" bra kanontold reporters after the council adjourned. bra kanon reckonedthe world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000tonnes estimated by the icco statistics committee.    however, some producer and consumer members emerged fromthe final icco council meeting with reservations about thepact.    ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the worlds mostexpensive and provides 60 pct of the countrys export earnings,made a formal protest to the council about the pricedifferentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too highfor ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock.    according to consumer spokesman peter baron of westgermany, ""consumers werent perfectly happy with the bufferstock rules. we reached a very sensitive compromise...therewere no real winners or losers.""    some european community delegates were not satisfied thatimportant points were fully discussed during the talks, and asa result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses aseffectively as they could have, delegates said.    under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seekoffers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials toreflect different qualities. non-icco member cocoa can compriseup to 15 pct of the total buffer stock.    london cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg pertonne, down from around 1,450 stg in january 1987 and 1,750 stgin january 1986.    a cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council sessiondecides market conditions warrant it, according to theagreement.    the withholding scheme can only be used if prices fallbelow the 1,600 sdr lower intervention price for more than fivedays and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity hasbeen filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says.    the icco will discuss withholding scheme rules at anexecutive committee meeting on june 9/12, icco officials said. reuter"

10959,coffee,"ibc expected to maintain coffee export formulathe brazilian coffee institute,ibc, is expected to maintain its previous pricing system whenit reopens export registrations, probably later this week,exporters said.    they said ibc president jorio dauster is likely to leavethe basic formula for the minimum registration price unchangedbut raise the contribution quota to partially offset theeffects of cruzado devaluation since april registrations wereclosed in mid-february.    to fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have tobe around 28 dlrs per bag against 7.0 when registrations closed.    however, even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contributionquota would make brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets,and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely, theexporters said.    they added that dauster is keen to raise the contributionquota as the institute needs money to repay central governmnetfunds released to finance ibc purchases at the guaranteedproducer price.    although a vote in the monetary council to provide morefunds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds lastweek, funds are still being released for subsequent approval.    the sources said it is still unclear when registrationswill be reopened, although most expect it to be by the end ofthis week.    ""brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentionsknow. a country like brazil cannot afford to be permanentlyclosed down,"" one exporter said.    however, before announcing its export policy the ibc islikely to wait to see if tomorrows meeting of theinternational coffee organisation, ico, executive board inlondon decides to call a full council meeting to discussreintroduction of export quotas, sources said.    there is also talk of the announcement this week of newmeasures to adjust the brazilian economy, and the ibc could beawaiting clarification before making any move, the exporterssaid.    another factor which could be delaying the opening ofregistrations is the current strike by bank workers which,while not affecting current shipments, could affectdocumentation and currency operations for new sales.    this would certainly be the case if the ibc was consideringobliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two orthree days of registering a sale."

""it sounds like a good deal,"" stuart mckibbin of <a.c. goodeand co> told reuters.    csr said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gasinterests held in the <delhi australia fund> and would insteadsell it to exxon corp <xon> unit <esso exploration andproduction australia inc> for 985 mln dlrs.    in a twin announcement csr, already australias largestsugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct itdoes not already hold in <pioneer sugar mills ltd>.    ""this will be a big shock to the market, which was under theimpression that csr was well down the road to floating delhi,""mckibbin said.    a float of part of delhi would have raised between 200 and300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, csr had givenitself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark onan ambitious expansion programme in its best-performingdivisions of sugar and building products, analysts said.    csr not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the rightto share equally with esso any higher returns resulting from anoil price over 20 u.s. dlrs a barrel in the next two years.    delhi is one of australias largest onshore oil producersyielding about six mln barrels a year from the cooper basin.analysts said the deal could net csr as much as three mln dlrsfor every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs.    neale goldston-morris of sydney broker <bain and co ltd>said the move out of delhi and investment in the sugar industrywas a sensible one but added that it represented the loss ofaustralian-owned assets to a foreign company.    ""the farm they bought back a few years ago is being soldback to the americans,"" goldston-morris said.    the pioneer sugar investment would make csr by far thelargest player in australias 850 mln dlr a year sugar industryand would give it access to some of the best sugar propertiesand mills in the country, analysts said.    they said pioneer sugar was expected to recommendacceptance of the bid through which csr would benefit from thebottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.    sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne nextseason from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said.    selling delhi meant csr has finally quit a damaginginvestment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the companysoverall performance, analysts said.    csr last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses onwhat had been a 591 mln u.s. dlr investment financed entirelyfrom u.s. dollar debt, they said.

11830,gold,"proposed japan tax may dampen tokyo gold tradinga proposed sales tax on gold transactionscould put a damper on the tokyo market and encourage a shift oftrading to hong kong and singapore, senior vice president andtokyo branch manager of credit suisse paul hofer told a pressconference.    ""if you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions,tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,""he said. the tax would create such a spread that japanese wouldbe unable to compete in the international market, he added.    ""how can the government really raise taxes if the systemthey impose is prohibitive of generating business?"" he said.    the government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical tradesexceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yentax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said.    the new five pct tax would be imposed on companies tradingmore than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades,gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well asthat of jewellery and coins, dealers said.    however, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery andcoins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said.    hofer said in 1982 switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct goldturnover tax on jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on oct 1, 1986.    a study by one of the swiss banks showed that in early1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all swiss banksfell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, hofer said.    transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of thevolume prior to imposition of the tax, he said.    while gold transactions in switzerland decreased, thevolume of trades outside the country, particularly in londonand luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, hofer said.    japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly averagejust under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said.    last year japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but thegovernment had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins tocommemorate the 60th year of emperor hirohitos reign, dealerssaid.    gold trading in tokyo is dominated mainly by japanesetrading companies, while credit suisse is the major foreignparticipant.    daily turnover in the tokyo spot market ranges between oneand 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, whilefutures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealerssaid.    ""all of us are concerned daily with the fact that the tokyomarket is growing, that japan is becoming one of the threemajor financial markets in the world ... and in my personalopinion i think it would be a very big mistake to put a damperon this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,""hofer said.

""the cost of maintaining such a stock can be high and itwill be a real messy business for the government and the tradeif it ever occurs,"" an industry source said.    the growers and traders also said that under new bufferstock rules malaysia can continue to benefit even if it is nota member of the pact, as the buffer stock manager is alsoallowed to buy from non-members for the stockpile.    under the new rules purchases from non-members, such asmalaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock.    malaysia has come under pressure from some producers tojoin the pact soon, officials said, but they noted that it neednot rush to do so as there are provisions which allow countriesto join the agreement even at a later date. reuter"

11882,coffee,"kenyan minister forecasts economic expansionkenyas economy will continue to expandthis year and the government will do more to encourageinvestment by foreign firms and the local private sector,planning minister robert ouko said.    he told a news conference that the government would sooncreate a special bureau to expedite processing of investmentapplications by local and foreign investors.    praising the role of multinational companies and localentrepreneurs in kenyas economy, the minister promised tomaintain a close working contact with the private sector.    the economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in1985, ouko said.    this was owing to high prices for the countrys coffeeexports, low oil prices, low inflation and rising real incomes,he added.    ""despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices,kenyas economy is still expected to improve in 1987,"" theplanning minister said.    ""high aggregate demand arising from low inflation, tradeliberalisation and disciplined financial management areexpected to increase output in the manufacturing sector,"" hesaid.    agriculture would expand significantly if favourableweather continued and farmers responded to producer price risesannounced in february, the minister added.    kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of thelong rainy season, which is due to start about now.    ouko said the production of kenyas main cash cropsincreased during the second half of last year.    coffee deliveries to the state-run coffee board of kenyarose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period,he said.    ouko paid tribute to the private sector for itscontribution to the economy and promised to improve governmentcooperation with businessmen by maintaining regular contactwith them.    ""i wish to pay tribute to the private sector for itscontribution to the economy in 1986 and challenge it tomaintain the same spirit this year ... the manufacturing sectorgrew by an estimated 5.8 pct in 1986, in line with the sameperiod the previous year,"" he said.    ouko said the ""one stop"" bureau was intended to stimulateinvestment and cut the time and bureacracy currently involvedin processing applications.    the planning minister presented a review of the kenyaneconomy during the second half of 1986 which showed inflationfalling to 4.3 pct from 10.2 a year earlier.    this was owing to higher agricultural production and thekenyan shillings relative strength against other majorcurrencies, the report said.    the average exchange rate was 16.23 shillings per u.s. dlrlast year, a fall of only 1.2 pct from 16.432 in 1985. the halfyearly report said exports increased about 30 pct injuly-december 1986, while imports rose by only six pct duringthe period.    this gave kenya an overall balance of payments surplus of780 mln kenya shillings (48 mln dlrs) during the period,compared with a 1.4 billion shilling (87 mln dlr) deficit inthe second half of 1985, it said. reuter"

""we have resolved major differences of opinion,"" he toldreuters.    xuto said the way is now cleared for drafting a new accord,to replace the current one which expires in october.    xuto said: ""i welcome the friendly and cooperativeatmosphere that has prevailed without interruption"" since thetalks began last monday.    ""it is my hope that delegations will go back home and try toratify the new agreement,"" he added.    the renegotiation conference, under the auspices of theu.n. conference on trade and development (unctad), is thefourth such meeting in two years.    xuto said producers and consumers had agreed on fourpoints:    1) regular price reviews will be held every 15 months.    previously consumers were proposing 12-month intervalsbetween price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact.    2) if the average of the daily market indicator prices oversix months prior to a review is below (or above) the lowerintervention price (or the upper intervention price), thereference price will be automatically revised downwards (orupwards) by five pct unless the international natural rubberorganisation council decides on a higher percentage.    if buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300,000 tonnes,the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pctunless the council decides on a higher percentage.    3) if the buffer stock reaches 400,000 tonnes, the price atwhich the additional contingency stock of 150,000 tonnes isbrought into operation will be two malaysian/singapore centsabove the floor price -- or 152 cents.    4) the floor price will not be breached. throughout thetalks producers had adamantly resisted a consumer proposal tolower the floor price of 150 cents if the buffer stock,currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes.    the proposal, initiated by the u.s., was withdrawn lastnight, setting the stage for compromise.    legal drafting of provisions will start next week andformal adoption of the new accord by the 40 countries takingpart in the conference is expected to take place on march 20.    the current conference was widely seen as the last chanceto clinch a deal. three previous attempts to negotiate a newfive- year pact had failed, the last round breaking down inoctober over consumer demands for tighter controls of thebuffer stock.    the united states, japan, west germany, france, italy andbritain are the major consumers.    unctads latest estimates project an increase of 8.5 pct inrubber prices this year and 4.1 pct in 1988. reuter"

5169,veg-oil,"tense trade ties to dominate ec talkstense trade relations with the u.s.and japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposedeuropean community (ec) tax on edible oils and fats areexpected to dominate talks by ec foreign ministers heretomorrow.    ec diplomats said britain demanded the early debate on theec executive commissions proposal to impose a hefty tax ondomestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off aproposal it sees as extremely damaging to ec foreign relations.    the proposal was the most controversial part of a reformpackage, due to be discussed by ec farm ministers later thismonth, of the ecs common agricultural policy -- widely seen asthe root cause of the ecs persistent financial problems and oftensions with major trading partners.    the proposal is described by its promoters as astabilisation program which would penalise a new sector goinginto massive overproduction and complement proposals to cutcereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forwardtax.    they say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fatsproduction and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left bya fall in ec output, but would also save the ec some twobillion european currency units, over two billion dlrs, in farmcosts.    it has provoked strong protests from domestic producers aswell as foreign exporters, led by the united states.    the diplomats said the protests had been received from mostcorners of the developing and developed world, ranging fromsenegal, malaysia and indonesia, to brazil, argentina, canada,iceland and norway.    the proposal had little chance of approval by ecgovernments, with west germany as strongly opposed to it asbritain, and denmark, the netherlands and portugal alsounconvinced of its political or economic wisdom.    even mediterranean countries such as italy, france andgreece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did notseem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added tothe list of products affected.    but the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the u.s.and elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promoteanti-ec action, and the foreign ministers debate shoulddemonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal withinthe ec and deprive its oponents of this argument.    the ministers were also due to discuss proposals in theu.s. congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as abill that would curb ec textile exports.    the diplomats said the ministers were expected to stronglyback a commission warning to washington that such a bill, ifenacted, would provoke swift ec retaliation. reuter"

5214,sugar,"european beet plantings seen little changedeuropean sugar beet plantings areexpected to show little change from last year, despite recentfirmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said.    a reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while,so far, european community (ec) growers plan unchanged to lowerareas, increases are expected in some eastern european nations.    trade analysts said their private reports give similarresults and do not differ significantly from the first estimateof stagnant 1987 european beet plantings made last week by westgerman sugar statistician f. o. licht.    areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agriculturalexperts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improvedseed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this.in recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a lateboost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointingstarts to growing seasons.    changes in ec areas reflect the extent to which producerswill grow so-called ""c"" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the worldmarket. this is what is produced in excess of the basic areaneeded to meet the ec ""a"" and ""b"" quotas, which receive full andpartial price support, respectively.    some analysts said the open row that broke out last weekbetween producers and the ec commission over its export policycould have serious implications for future sugar output.    beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearlyone mln tonnes of white sugar into ec intervention stocks asthey feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate forthe gap between high ec internal and low world market prices.    however, with the ec budget stretched to breaking point,this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resistinghigher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a futurecut in the basic ""a"" and ""b"" quotas, they added.    in france, the largest producer of ec quota and non quotasugar, the sugar market intervention board firs said firstplanting intentions indicate an area about the same as lastyears 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year.    ""the basic trend is towards stability,"" a firs spokesmansaid. unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, whitesugar french franc prices are not particularly high and are notencouraging higher planting levels, he said. beet sugar outputlast year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00tonnes per ha, the highest in the ec apart from the netherlandsbut below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11.    in west germany, recent price rises have not altered plans,since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industrysources said. the farm ministry said a december survey is stillvalid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmedby just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average.    licht last week estimated west german plantings at areduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year.    british sugar plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signedup u.k. farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. this shouldyield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. last years cropequalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes.    british sugar has ""a"" and ""b"" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnesof whites and its ""c"" output is due to improved yields from moreconsistent disease-resistant seed types.    recent price rises have not altered polish plans, wincentynowicki, a deputy director of cukropol, the amalgamated sugarindustry enterprises, said. world prices are still below polishproduction costs and there is no way to convince farmers toincrease the area above the already signed contracted level.    the national plan, set before prices began to rise, putplantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in1986, nowicki said. last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes.    world prices have less impact in italy than in france orgermany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared tothe domestic market, an official at the national beet growersassociation said. italian sowings are not yet complete butsurveys suggest a drop from last years 270,000 ha, especiallyin the north where some farmers have switched to soya.    beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higherthan expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar.    dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from arecord 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comesinto force, a spokesman for centrale suiker, the second largestdutch sugar processor, said.    the new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnesof white sugar and to cut output of ""c"" sugar. last year, thenetherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugaragainst a combined ""a"" and ""b"" quota of only 872,000 tonnes.    ""the world price of sugar would have to rise much higherthan it has done recently to make planned production of ""c"" sugarreally worthwhile,"" the spokesman said.    western agricultural experts in moscow said soviet plantingintentions are likely to be unchanged. licht put this yearssoviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year.    hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some95,000 in 1986, the official mti news agency said, butdiplomats said policy is to balance supply with domesticdemand.    the spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings areestimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year.    a spokesman for denmarks largest beet concern, de danskesukkerfabrikker a/s, said its 1987 sugar target was unchangedfrom 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha.    in sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domesticdemand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 haagainst 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugarcompany svenska sockerfabriks ab.    last year, irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due tolate sowings and the state-run irish sugar plc said the 1987plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, downfrom 37,600 in 1986. reuter"

5258,cocoa,"cocoa latest focus for commodity pact negotiatorsthe credibility of government efforts tostabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to thetest over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how abuffer stock should operate in the cocoa market, governmentdelegates and trade experts said.    only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped wheninternational coffee organization members failed to agree onhow coffee export quotas should be calculated. this week, manyof the same experts gather in the same building here to try toagree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work.    the still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding theinternational tin council (itc), which had buffer stock lossesrunning into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also castinga shadow over commodity negotiations.    the itcs failure has restricted negotiators ability tocompromise as governments do not want to be involved in pactswith built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clearlines drawn between aid and trade.    a more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basicelements of a new international natural rubber agreement ingeneva at the weekend.    some importing countries insist the international cocoaorganization (icco) buffer stock rules must not be muddied withquota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa tobe bought. one consumer country delegate said this would""distort, not support"" the market.    trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the iccofor destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffeeprices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts canfounder. on friday this uncertainty helped push london cocoafutures down to eight month lows. the strength of sterling hasalso contributed to the recent slip in prices.    the icco daily and average prices on friday fell below the""must buy"" level of 1,600 sdrs a tonne designated in the pact,which came into force at the last icco session in january butwithout rules for the operation of the buffer stock.    consumers and producers could not agree on how it shouldoperate and what discretion it should be given. the agreementlimits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says itcannot operate on futures markets.    a cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying orselling operations, were carried forward from the previousagreement.    members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy onall cocoa they trade. it has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes.    the key arguments being faced by the icco working group onbuffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will beover non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock shouldpay when trading different types of cocoa. another workinggroup is scheduled to meet wednesday to discuss administrativematters, and the full council meets on thursday.    producers have so far maintained that buffer stock fundsshould not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-membercountries such as malaysia.    consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the bufferstock should buy it rather than compete with chocolatemanufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas.    the argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linkedto the one over differentials for different qualities.    european industry and trade advisers have suggested as acompromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that canrepresent non-member cocoa and that it use the london futuresmarkets existing differentials for different qualities.    currently, good west african cocoa is tendered at par ontothe london market.    discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50stg a tonne for brazilian and malaysian cocoa.    consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse wouldoperate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell thehighest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower.    the january talks were slowed by a split inside theeuropean community, a key icco consumer group, with francesiding with producers. ec representatives met in closed sessionin brussels on friday in an attempt to reach a common groundand, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positionsamong the 12 nations.    the source said the ec will be looking for signs offlexibility on the part of producers in the next few days andwill be able to respond if they are there.    one icco delegate describing the producer/consumer splitsaid consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less andbacks the concept of the pact which is ""meant to support themarket where trade buying is not.""    in contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell theircocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers.    other, more technical, issues still outstanding includewhether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced""posted price"" as in the previous pact or by announcing it isbuying then accepting offers.    in either case, delegates said, it is accepted thatproducers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers ofcocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in away that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers. reuter"

5471,coffee,"colombia coffee exporters believe in pragmatismprivate coffee exporters say colombiasmore pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that thecountry does not suffer excessively from current depressedprices and erratic market conditions.    gilberto arango, president of the exporters association,said in an interview that colombia, the worlds second largestproducer, was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence ofinternational coffee organization (ico) export quotas.    ""colombia is one of the countries that will benefit mostfrom this situation,"" he said.    recent ico talks in london failed to break a deadlock overre-introduction of export quotas, suspended in february 1986,and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue.    arango said that government measures adopted here lastweek, including a lower export registration price, indicated amajor change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism.    ""this is the start of a new era in colombia because worldmarket conditions are also new,"" he said.    the government lowered local taxes for exporters and saidthe export registration price, or reintegro, will be changedmore often in order to closely reflect market trends.    arango said an illustration of colombias new attitude wasthe decision on friday to open export registrations for anunlimited amount.    but he added it did not imply the country would begin heavyselling of coffee.    ""our marketing policy is to sell without haste butconsistently. no targets for volume will be set. we will reactto market factors adequately and colombia has no intention ofgiving its coffee away.""    colombias past records should be the basis for upcomingexports, he said.    ""we will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags butneither are we going to sell like mad. the trade knows fullwell what colombias export potential is,"" he said.    colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags,exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee yearwhich ended last september, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986.    arango did not want to commit himself on export predictionsbut said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would notexceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by thenational coffee growers federation and 12.5 mln by the u.s.department of agriculture, a figure he said was ""ridiculous.""    he said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in thenumber one producing province of antioquia, meant output waslikely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare andoscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags.    on the failure of the recent ico talks, arango saidcolombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managedto force a compromise.    jorge cardenas, manager of the national federation and headof his nations delegation in london, has blamed theintransigence of some big countries, without naming them.    however, arango, like colombian finance minister cesargaviria last week, was more explicit and said the united stateswould undoubtedly be under great political pressure in comingweeks to revise its policy.    ""washington will have to take into account that for manycountries, and some of its allies for instance in centralamerica, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would havefar-reaching political and economic consequences.""    arango ruled out a fresh colombian initiative on exportquotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve whichcould emerge from continuous contacts. reuter"

""the two ports cannot in any way and in their present formhandle the huge exports of zambian copper,"" one western diplomatsaid.

13462,cocoa,"cocoa buffer stock may face uphill battle - tradethe international cocoa organization(icco) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt thedowntrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buyingoperations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said.    traders said they believed buffer stock purchases couldreach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting pricessignificantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhangingthe market. the buffer stock may begin buying shortly as theicco 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 specialdrawing rights (sdr) per tonne, below the 1,600 ""must buy"" level.    rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed lastmonth by the icco council. buying will begin once the bufferstock manager has completed preparations, traders said.    some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay bufferstock buying until mid or end-april when changes in months usedto calculate the icco indicator may lift the 10 day averageabove the 1,600 sdr ""must buy"" level.    the icco indicator price is calculated from the average ofthe second, third and fourth positions on the london and newyork futures markets. the daily price was 1,577.61 sdr pertonne yesterday.    months used currently for the indicator are may, july andseptember, but these are set to change to july, september anddecember on april 15, prior to may becoming the new york spotmonth, traders noted.    the introduction of december into the calculations may liftthe daily sdr price as december is currently quoted about 75stg above may on the london terminal market.    but the buffer stock manager would have to wait for thehigher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, theindicator which governs his activities, traders said.    ""the buffer stock manager is obviously looking at theimplications of delaying until forward prices lift theindicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa,"" ananalyst from a leading cocoa trade house said.    traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. if purchases reachthis level within six months, buying is suspended pending anicco council review of price ranges. but some cocoa marketwatchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recentforecasts for a poor brazilian bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mlnto two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up tothree mln.    a lower than expected brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, comparedwith a recent forecast by the icco statistics committee of94,000 tonnes, traders said.    in these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need tobuy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the""must buy"" level.    but some dealers said the icco buffer stock rules may putconstraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stockmanager can remove cocoa from the market.    the buffer stock system of price differentials setaccording to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases fromnon-members could limit the buffer stocks scope for action,dealers said.    most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock isnearby in-store material of malaysian and ivory coast origin.    but the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct malaysian cocoa asmalaysia is not an icco member, while purchases of nearby cocoacan only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the bufferstock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material.    limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-membercocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which arepressured by the overhang of malaysian material, traders said.    buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa fromquality producers such as ghana will have only a limited impacton futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums forthis cocoa over futures.    ghanas premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stgfrom 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of bufferstock buying, dealers said.    ""the buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but willprovide a backstop for quality cocoas,"" one trader said.    traders cautioned that views on the impact of the bufferstock were ""all prognostication"" and that no one could hope topredict accurately what the result would be. psychologicallybuffer stock buying should help prices, but since the bufferstock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from theprevious cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealersexpressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure.    in june the icco is due to discuss rules for a withholdingscheme as an additional market support mechanism. reuter"

7088,gold,"new market emerges in warrants for golda new market has emerged in warrants tobuy gold, a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the playof commodity options into the field of securities.    over the past three weeks, swiss offices of american bankshave launched a total of four issues of warrants with varyingconditions, drawing on renewed inflationary worries and therecovery of the gold price last year.    and credit suisse and credit suisse-first boston eachissued swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have asimilar character, though they are aimed at a less professionalmarket.    the market is still small. taken together, the fouramerican-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln swissfrancs.    but banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors andpredicted a lively future.    andrew barrett of citicorp investment bank (switzerland) agsaid: ""the warrants give smaller investors a chance to have along-term investment in gold with limited risk.""    citicorp in zurich launched the first of these warrants onfebruary 27, following it up with a second issue less than aweek later. the issuer in both cases was citibank na.    the idea found some quick copies. goldman sachs in zurichorganized and co-led an issue for the swiss branch of banqueindosuez on march 9 and last night morgan guaranty(switzerland) ag did another for morgan guaranty trust co ofnew york.    the four issues now offer investors striking prices forgold ranging from the indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, thesame price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level onthe first one for citibank.    the premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturitiesfrom 18 months to four years and three months, in all caseslonger than gold futures and options on u.s. markets.    the bankers traced the inspiration for the market back tothe february report of u.s. consumer prices for january, when ajump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation.    ""many people are worried about inflation again,"" said matsjoensson of goldman sachs. ""money supply in germany and theunited states has grown very strongly in the last year andpeople want to take a ride on gold.""    the gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, haslanguished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past fewweeks. but the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a morehighly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited.    barrett said it was natural that the market developed inswitzerland. ""people here understand gold, and they understandwarrants,"" he said.    citicorp (switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series ofequity-linked covered issues based on japanese company sharesover the past two years, and last autumn, swiss banks launchedcovered warrants in swiss registered shares in a bid to giveforeign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closedto all but swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage.    but after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried upwhen swiss shares prices fell from their january peaks.    the issues are being marketed not on the basis of simplepremiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to providescientific comparisons between titles in the options market.    martin bachem of morgan guaranty said his banks issue wascompetitive despite its relatively high premium. the issue, forfive ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 swiss francs, makinga premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct.    using a black sholes options model, he said the issueslong, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicitvolatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off,which he claimed was lower than the other issues.    but barrett said the black sholes variant citicorp usedpointed to a higher volatily for the morgan issue andemphasized that the models were at best an inexact science.    and each bank, using its own model, put the implicitvolatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct.    whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warmwelcome from investors.    joensson of goldman sachs said there was a lot of demand,even among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrantsapiece. ""the most sophisticated ones wouldnt buy these becausethe premiums are too high,"" he said. reuter"

7161,iron-steel,"ec ministers agree need for big steel closureseuropean community (ec) industryministers today declared there is a need for a massive round ofclosures of steel plants to bring capacity in the 12-countrybloc into reasonable balance with demand.    the ministers were meeting to discuss a plan for voluntaryplant closures drawn up by the industry lobby group euroferwhich it calculates would cost around 22,000 jobs.    diplomats said that in their initial reactions to thescheme, most ministers declared it was a useful basis fordiscussion, but did not go nearly far enough.    eurofer says it has identified scope for the closure ofplants which have an annual capacity of 15.26 mln tonnes,provided the companies concerned can be fully repaid by the ecor national governments for redundancy and other social costs.    but ec executive commission sources said industrycommissioner karl-heinz narjes told ministers today that 30 mlntonnes of annual capacity was excess to requirements and shouldbe closed by the end of 1990.    he said the eurofer plan in particular fails to pinpointthe scope for closure in heavy hot-rolled wide-strip products,typically produced in plants employing thousands of people.    the sources said no minister challenged narjes analysisthat four or five hot-rolled wide-strip lines would have toclose.    they said ministers agreed that the eurofer plan should beexpanded and developed through meetings among the industrybody, the commission and representatives of member states.    however, diplomats said it was clear from todaysdiscussions that such meetings will be difficult.    they said member states are split on whether to reduce thescope of a quota production system, which at present protectsec steelmakers from the full force of competition for 65 pct oftheir products, while talks on the closure plan proceed.    it was also clear that there will be tough talks on whichec member states should bear the brunt of the closures and onhow much funding for help to those thrown out of work shouldcome from community coffers.    german minister martin bangemann said his countrys steelindustry, the largest in the ec, should not sufferproportionately more than others, german sources said.    but british diplomats said their minister, giles shaw,insists that the profitability of companies should be takeninto account.    the state owned british steel corporation, benefitting frommassive recent write-offs of its accumulated debts, iscurrently one of the few ec steel companies in the black.    ministers were this afternoon trying to agree a jointstatement on the eurofer plan and the situation in theindustry. reuter"

""the successful negotiation of the new agreement representsa significant step forward in international economiccooperation,"" he told a news conference. the new inra is toreplace the current one which expires in october.    delegates at the renegotiation conference, held under theauspices of the u.n. conference on trade and development(unctad), reached agreement over the central elements of a newaccord last weekend.    xuto said the new inra retains the reference price -- of201.66 malaysian/singapore cents per kilo -- and indicativeprices set in the present pact.    price levels will continue to be expressed in the jointmalaysian/singapore currency, he added.    the new agreement also maintains the basic structure ofprice ranges -- the ""may sell"" and ""may buy"" points at plus andminus 15 pct of the reference price, as well as the ""must sell""and ""must buy"" zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it.    xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives thatwere set in the present accord. ""the most important of these areto stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth betweendemand and supply,"" he said. the buffer stock remains the soleinstrument of market intervention for price stabilisation andits maximum capacity is unchanged at 550,000 tonnes, xutoadded.    at this months session, which was the fourth attempt intwo years to negotiate a new inra, the main issue to beresolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the referenceprice.    it was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference priceevery 15 months -- instead of the current 18-month intervals.    the extent of the adjustment was also modified.    under the present agreement if the daily market indicatorprice has been above the upper intervention (""may sell"") price(currently 231 malaysian/singapore cents) or below the lowerintervention price (""may buy"") price (171 cents at present) forsix months, the reference price is then revised by five pct orwhatever amount the international natural rubber councildecides.    under the new pact, the adjustment under thesecircumstances will be five pct unless the council decides on ahigher adjustment.    similarly, when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to300,000 tonnes, there would be an automatic adjustment of threepct under the new accord unless the council decides on a higherpercentage.    throughout the talks, which began on march 9, producers hadstrongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the referenceprice and the ""lower indicative price"" (or floor price) of 150cents in the present pact if the buffer stock, currently360,000 tonnes, reached 450,000 tonnes.    the proposal, initiated by the u.s., was withdrawn lastfriday, setting the stage for compromise at the weekend.    since then negotiators have worked on the finer details ofthe new pact.    on the question of conditions for entry into force of thenew inra, xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governmentsaccounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of worldimports approved or ratified the new agreement before it becameoperational.    the present agreement had a figure of 80 pct. reuter"
7308,sugar,"ec may offer intervention sugar to local marketsugar which ec producers plan to sellinto intervention may be offered by the european commission forsale within the community, broker c. czarnikow says in itslatest sugar review.    the commission will propose to offer the sugar at a verynominal premium of 0.01 european currency unit (ecu) to theintervention price, with detrimental consequences forproducers returns, czarnikow says. the move is seen as anattempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrenderedsugar.    the commission may also take other steps to dissuadeproducers from their chosen course, such as removing the timelimit on storage contracts, which presently means thatintervention stocks have to be removed by the end of september,czarnikow says. there is also the possibility of productionquotas being reduced.    if the commission decided to offer the sugar to traders forexport, the restitutions would have to be higher than those atrecent export tenders, czarnikow notes. to match the differencebetween the ec price and the world market price, the extracosts might be as much as 20 ecus per tonne, it says.    the producers might have to repay these costs throughproduction levies and the proposed special elimination levy,czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costscould be recovered under ec rules.    the primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes ofsugar into intervention in france is dissatisfaction with theec export program as the restitution has increasingly failed tobridge the gap between the ec price and the world market price,czarnikow notes. the french move is thus seen as a form ofprotest designed to force the commissions hand.    in west germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered forintervention, but czarnikow says the motive here is to ensurethat the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in1986. in addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price,west german producers face a further price reduction in julywith a probable revaluation of the ""green"" mark.    even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem isnot expected to disappear permanently. it has appeared totraders for some years that the ecs export policy isinsufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, itsays.    the weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand byincreasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, czarnikow says,suggesting that the commission might also take steps to cutdown the amount of ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" surrounding theexport tender system. reuter"

""thus, ccc could own the equivalent of brazils entiresoybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987,"" haggard said.    however, haggard said that the u.s. should be cautious inmaking soybean program changes that might allow the europeancommunity to challenge the u.s. program under the generalagreement on tariffs and trade, gatt.    he noted that the ec imports one quarter of u.s. soybeanproduction and loss of that market would be devastating.    the reagan administration has given ""mixed signals"" onwhether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could besuccessfully challenged in gatt by the ec, haggard said.    while the asa position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per buloan rate combined with a marketing loan, haggard also endorseda proposal by rep. jerry huckaby, d-la., which would set a sixdlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan.    the huckaby proposal is also supported by the rankingrepublican on the house agriculture committee, rep. edwardmadigan of illinois.    subcommittee chairman glickman endorsed the need to takesome action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loancould mean a substantial increase in budget costs.    glickman noted that the agriculture committee must cut oneto 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and thereforemust fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget.    haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bucombined with a marketing loan, the u.s. soybean price mightfall to four dlrs per bu initially. this would cost thegovernment a maximum of two billion dlrs. but he said the costswould decline as market prices recovered. reuter"

""no replanting programme has been successful,"" said almyhafild from the indonesian network for forest conservation.    ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the nexttwo years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denudedland in the philippines.    the experts say that without a major initiative from thedevelopment banks, the vicious circle will continue withcountries cutting more forest to help service short-term debtsat the cost of long-term insolvency.    yet timber, a five billion dlr a year industry, is notnecessarily the most direct economic product of the forests,and nations must be educated in how best to ""farm"" them, saidpeter kramer, world wildlife fund (wwf) conservation director.    there is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the endproducts of rattan, and brazil nuts earn brazil 16 mln dlrs ayear, he said.    u.s. pharmacologist norman farnsworth has calculated that25 pct of all u.s. prescriptions owe their active ingredientsto higher plants growing in the forests.    deforestation would wipe out the chance of furtherdiscoveries and force major corporations to research, developand produce man-made substitutes, at a cost which scientistssay is incalculable.    by the year 2000, only 10 developing nations will still beexporting timber, from 33 currently, and their export earningswill drop from a 1980 peak of 6.8 billion dlrs to less than twobillion, a world bank and u.n. sponsored survey said.    of the 20.3 billion dlrs advanced by the world bank,inter-american, african and asian development banks in 1980-84,only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects, it said.    wwf statistics show half of the worlds tropical forestshave vanished since the 1940s. of 2,000 mln hectares remaining,up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive loggingpractises and by local farmers. reuter"

""producers are taking measures for increasing theirproduction when the prices are profitable,"" he said.    officials in mexico, guatemala and ecuador said a continuedrise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leadersin panama and costa rica said there was still a long way to go.    ""the prices are ridiculous,"" said julian mateo, vicepresident of costa ricas sugar cane industrial-agriculturalleague. ""at current prices nobody is going to considerincreasing production.""    other producers are wary of committing funds to increasingoutput, given the instability of world markets.    an official at colombias national association of sugarcane growers said they had no plans to raise export targets.""the market is very unstable. what is happening is not yetgiving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modifyanything.""    in 1985, the latest year for which full figures areavailable, central and south american nations produced 28 mlntonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. ayear earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000more, according to the london-based international sugarorganization.    years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugarindustry in many countries in the region into a recession fromwhich it will be hard to recover.    miguel guerrero, director of the dominican republicsnational sugar institute, said it would be difficult to boostproduction even if prices recovered sharply.    output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from900,000 in the late 1970s. obsolete refineries, poor transportand badly maintained plantations were barriers to any shortterm recovery in output, he added.    plans of nearby cuba, the worlds largest cane sugarexporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the endof the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. output isrunning well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970.    cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problemsand poor processing facilities more than from low world prices,since much of its output is sold to eastern bloc countriesunder special deals. last year, bad weather added to itstroubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in1985.    the low world prices of recent years have led manycountries in the region to cut exportable production to levelswhere they barely cover u.s. and, in the case of some caribbeancountries, european community (ec) import quotas, for whichthey receive prices well above free market levels.    progressive reductions in the u.s. quotas have led toproduction stagnating or falling rather than being shifted tothe free world market.    peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the u.s. inboth 1983 and 1984. this fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this yearits quota is only 37,000.    a national cooperative official said that, as long as worldmarket levels continue at around half of perus productioncost, the future of the industry is uncertain.    at a meeting of geplacea in brazil last october officialsstressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar canewhich, according to the groups executive-secretary eduardolatorre, ""grows like a weed"" throughout the region.    brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240mln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. cane inexcess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined intosugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency.    the difference in the price the state-run sugar and alcoholinstitute (iaa) pays local industry and what it receives fromforeign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year.    soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over thepast year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meantbrazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in1987, trade sources said. negotiations to delay shipments tonext year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking pointbeing how brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery ofsugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which wouldcost eight cents to replace.    brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar exportsales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, withthe institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages ofeither alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuilddepleted reserve stockpiles.    however, the situation could change dramatically if theeconomy goes into recession and internal demand slumps.    sources within latin america and the caribbean hold littlehope for the regions sugar industry to return to profitabilityunless the u.s. and ec change their policies.    ""the agricultural policies of the european community and ofthe united states have caused our economies incalculable harmby closing their markets, by price deterioration ininternational commerce and furthermore by the unfaircompetition in third countries,"" brazils trade and industryminister jose hugo castelo branco told the october geplaceameeting.    the ec has come under prolonged attack from geplacea forwhat the group charges is its continued dumping of excessoutput on world markets. geplacea officials say this is themain cause of low prices.    geplacea sees a new international sugar agreement whichwould regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling theregions industry out of steady decline. such an agreementwould have to have both u.s. and ec backing and industrialisedcountries would have to see it as a political rather than amerely economic pact.

12002,soybean,"shultz ussr trip fuels talk of eep wheat offerspeculation the united states willoffer subsidized wheat to the soviet union appears to havereached a new level of intensity in the run-up to secretary ofstate george shultz visit later this month to moscow.    rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheatmarkets since officials from the two countries held theircustomary, semi-annual grain talks in february. moscowsdecision at that time to reenter the u.s. corn marketstrengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.    shultz is set to arrive in moscow april 13.    shultz statement two weeks ago that he would not stand inthe way of a wheat subsidy offer under the export enhancementprogram, eep, coupled with the announcement of his visit tomoscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representativeshere as a clear signal that the reagan administration waspreparing an offer.    administration officials -- in and out of the u.s.agriculture department -- have been extremely tight-lippedabout the prospects of a subsidy offer.    but usda officials for the most part have abandoned thecontention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,while not a ""done deal,"" is a live possibility.    prominent u.s. grain trade representatives -- many of whomasked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that anoffer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.    others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,are saying they would not rule one out.    rep. pat roberts, r-kan., yesterday went so far as topredict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten daysto two weeks.    aides to roberts said he had spoken to republican leaderswho had been in contact with administration officials.    richard fritz, director of international marketing at u.s.wheat associates, said he was confident an export enhancementoffer would be made by the middle of this month.    fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would endup being close to the offer washington made peking earlier thisyear when usda approved subsidies to china of around 36 dlrsper tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.    some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheatsubsidy offer might help stimulate more soviet purchases ofu.s. corn and open the door to u.s. sales of soybeans.    as ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat dealwould appear to be price.    last summer the administration took the controversial stepof offering the soviets subsidized wheat -- but wereembarrassed when moscow spurned the proposal on the groundsthat the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left u.s. wheat pricesfar above world market prices.    the administrations decision to set the subsidy level upfront instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be ameans of controlling the price while attempting to dampencriticism, grain trade sources said.    nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent shultzfrom saying the soviets were ""chortling"" because washington wasoffering soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available tou.s. housewives.    the conventional wisdom among grain trade representativeshere is that a general warming of relations between the twocountries since last summer, combined with continued hard timesin the u.s. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.    in addition, the ussr has made it clear it would considerbuying u.s. wheat if it were priced more competitively.    however, observers have not forgotten the circumstancessurrounding the administrations announcement of the wheatsubsidy offer last summer.    up until the time of the announcment, congressional andindustry leaders were led to believe the white house haddecided to expand the export enhancement program to include notonly the soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.    instead, the administration scaled back the offer toinclude only the soviets.    that last-minute change of heart adds a measure ofuncertainty even to the predictions of those most convincedthat the administration will not now pass up the opportunity tosell four mln tonnes of wheat to the soviet union. reuter"

"
12011,coffee,"ico quotas before october unlikely - delegatesthe restoration of coffee export quotasbefore the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (oct 1/sept30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by internationalcoffee organization, ico, producers and consumers to resumenegotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegatestold reporters.    consumers and most producers see no point in reopening thequota dialogue while brazils position remains unchanged, theysaid.    brazils refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30pct share of the icos global export quota effectivelytorpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotasbefore october, the delegates noted.    disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forcedcoffee futures in london and new york to new lows today,traders here said. near may in new york fell below one dlr inearly trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said.    producer delegates said that while the possibility ofreimposing quotas before october remained on the ico agenda, inpractice the idea had effectively been discarded.    the icos executive board session here this week has so farbarely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating generalunwillingness to revive talks while chances of success arestill remote, producer delegates said.    some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored,despite the price collapse seen since the failure of lastmonths negotiations, they said.    ""with brazils frost season approaching, who wants tonegotiate quotas,"" one leading producer delegate said.    coffee prices normally rise during brazils frost season(mainly june-august) as dealers and roasters build up stocks asinsurance against possible severe frost damage to brazilscrop.    many producers are more interested in working towardsreimposing quotas from october 1, based on a new system ofquota allocations valid until the international coffeeagreement expires in 1989, they said.    guatemala has already proposed the ""other oilds"" producergroup should meet in the next two months to begin talks on howto allocate quota shares.    producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quotadistribution system, with some producer delegates reportinggrowing support for a radical reallocation, based on theprinciple of ""objective criteria"" favoured by consumers.    at last months council session a splinter group of smallproducers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based onexportable production and stocks, while brazil, colombia andthe rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocationsunchanged, except for some temporary adjustments.    a delegate from one of the eight said more producers nowsupported their cause.    the delegate said unless major producers like brazil showedreadiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quotaaccord in october also looked bleak.    the u.s. and most other consumers are still determined tomake reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution ofquota shares based on ""objective criteria.""    ico observers remained sceptical that brazil would beprepared to accept a quota reduction when the ico council meetsin september.    brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on externaldebt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee,they said.    they said brazils reluctance to open coffee exportregistrations might reflect fears this would provoke anotherprice slide and force an emergency ico council session, whichwould most likely end in failure.    producers met this afternoon to review the market situationbut had only a general discussion about how furthernegotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said.    producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and thenmay set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are notfixed, he said.    the ico executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local timeto hear a report from consultants on ico operations. the boardmeeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled,delegates said. reuter"

""prices for edible oils appear to have more upsidepotential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedenteddecline in the production of tree oils,"" balletto said.    balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palmkernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mlntonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output.    he estimated total vegetable oil production this year at33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearanceat 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln.    unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said,disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976.    ""if world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting thecrush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing inthe edible oils sector could develop,"" he said.    ""this would be relatively favorable for the prices of highoil yielding seeds,"" balletto said.    oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed pricesbecause of burdensome supplies, he said.    world ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increasefor the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes,compared with 25.4 mln last year.    the increase should result from lower disappearance, asproduction is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7mln last year, he said.    world soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mlntonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, balletto said,while production of other oilseeds was lower.    higher soybean production in south america and europe madeup for lower production in the united states, he said.    soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and u.s.stocks make up most of those, balletto said.    the commodity credit corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes,about half of the world soybean surplus, he said.    since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased13.1 mln tonnes.    ""during the same period, u.s. soybean stocks increased 12.1mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire worldsurplus, courtesy of the ccc and highlighting the artificiallyhigh prices caused by the u.s. loan program.""    ""soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseedsprices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as longas the u.s. soybean surplus continues.    for the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in arange tied to the u.s. loan program.    ""upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supplyoverhang while strong underlying support is provided by theu.s. loan rate.""    the problem is likely to become worse as the artificiallyhigh prices encourage producers in south america, canada andaustralia to shift from grains to oilseeds, balletto said. reuter"

8060,rubber,"main features of new rubber pactthe new international natural rubberagreement (inra), like the 1979 pact, will use a buffer stockas the sole instrument for market intervention -- excludingexport quotas or production controls.    the new inra was adopted yesterday at a session held underthe auspices of the united nations conference on trade anddevelopment (unctad).    in many respects the main features in the new pact resemblethose contained in the present one.    the reference price, currently 201.66 malaysian/singaporects per kilo, will be maintained -- unless between now andoctober 22, when the 1979 inra expires, the average of thedaily market indicator price remains above the upperintervention (""may sell"") price (231 cts) or below the lowerintervention (""may buy"") price (171 cts) for six months.    if this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikelyconsidering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts-- the price would be revised under the current accord by fivepct or by whatever amount the international natural rubbercouncil decides.    the new reference price would then be taken over for thenew agreement.    under the same circumstances in the new pact the referenceprice would be automatically revised by five pct unless thecouncil decides on a higher percentage.    similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, thereference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unlessthe council decides on a higher percentage.    another change introduced in the new inra is that pricereviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18.    those changes are intended to make the reference price moreresponsive to market trends.    as in the present accord the ""may buy"" and ""may sell"" levelsare set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the""must buy"" and ""must sell"" levels at 20 pct of it.    the lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceilingprices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless thecouncil decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months.    during the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposalthat the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock,currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes.    the maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is thesame as under the present one -- 400,000 tonnes, with provisionfor an additional contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes.    under the new accord, the contingency buffer stock will bebrought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price.    at last fridays session, ahmed farouk, speaking forproducers, said producing nations considered that the 1979 pacthad served the purpose for which it had been created.    gerard guillonneau of france, who spoke for consumers,agreed that the current agreement had worked ""relatively well.""    asked about the chances of success of the new inra,delegates noted that for nearly its whole life, the 1979 accordhad maintained the average price above the ""must buy"" level.    they said the agreement until now did not appear to haveencouraged excessive production of rubber.    in addition, provisions for borrowing to finance the bufferstock have now been eliminated, ruling out speculation. ""it is asort of middle-of-the-road agreement,"" one delegate said.    the new pact will be open for signature at u.n.headquarters in new york from may 1 to december 31 this year.    to become operational, it will require ratification bycountries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct ofworld imports.    delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months fromnow. during the hiatus between the two agreements, theinternational natural rubber council will remain in place.    the pact will enter into force definitively whengovernments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pctof world imports have ratified it. reuter"

""the atmosphere is excellent.""    other delegates said the buffer stock might not beoperational by monday but could be in place by around april 1,if the rules are agreed by friday.    a detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buyand sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working groupthis afternoon -- a big step toward a ""very interesting stage ofnegotiations,"" delegates said.    the package, based on negotiating principles informallyagreed by delegates, has been forged bit by bit duringfortnight-long meetings by icco executive director kobenaerbynn and a small group of other delegates.    producers, the european community (ec) and consumers arescheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointlytomorrow.    under the proposal, the buffer stock manager would buycocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offersystem. he would alert the market via news agencies as to whenhe wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnagedesired, delegates said.    the manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, ratherthan choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preferenceto icco member-country exporters. standard price differentialswould be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, todetermine the relative competitiveness of offers of variouscocoas from different origins, they said.    the differentials could be reviewed at the request of amember country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager,the delegates said. revision would be decided by a majorityvote of the icco council.    buffer stock purchases from non-icco member countries wouldnot be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, theysaid.    the purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa perday and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby,intermediate and forward positions, they added.    one of the underlying ideas of the rules package is""transparency,"" meaning virtually all the buffer stock managersmarket activities will be public and he will have as littlediscretion as possible, delegates said.    after the tin market collapse in 1985, when theinternational tin council buffer stock ran out of funds, cocoadelegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa marketmechanism, they said.     earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected tobegin late tomorrow, as delegations feel the pressure of theapproaching friday deadline, when the icco meeting is due toadjourn, delegates said.    the icco failed to agree buffer stock rules in january whenthe new international cocoa agreement came into force. theexisting buffer stock of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen inplace with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchableuntil rules are agreed.     though the current semi-annual council meeting is not thelast chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules,producers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizingmechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices,delegates said. reuter"

9203,rubber,"mixed asian reaction to new rubber pactgovernments of major asianproducing countries have welcomed the conclusion of a newinternational natural rubber agreement (inra), but growers andtraders are unhappy with the development, according to viewspolled by reuter correspondents.    officials in malaysia, indonesia and thailand, whichproduce the bulk of the worlds rubber, said they expected thenew pact to continue to stabilise prices and help their rubberindustries remain viable in the long-term.    but traders and growers said they were against the new pactbecause its buffer stock mechanism was likely to intereferewith free market forces and prevent sharp rubber price rises.    the new inra, to replace the current one which expires onoctober 22, was formally adopted by most of the worldsproducers and consumers in geneva last friday.    it will be open for signature at the u.n. headquarters innew york from may 1 to december 31 this year and will enterinto force provisionally when ratified by countries accountingfor 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports.    malaysian primary industries minister lim keng yaik saidthe formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears ofliquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of inra buffer stock rubberand a possible depression of prices.    he expressed confidence that the new inra would continue tokeep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices roseor fell through its buffer stock system.    malaysia was also happy that in the new inra financing ofpurchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and acontingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be donethrough direct cash contributions from members, he said.    under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks tofinance inras buffer stock purchases. this has been viewedwith concern by some members who fear the inra may becomeindebted and ultimately face collapse, like the internationaltin agreement.    ""this will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried outwithout any financial encumbrance,"" lim said.     malaysia, the worlds largest producer, was seekingcabinet approval to join the new inra and hoped other producersand consumers would also become members, he said.    officials in jakarta said the new pact would bring benefitto indonesias rubber industrys by stabilising prices.    it was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement becauseits new financial provisions had been tightened, they said.    thai officials told reuters they were optimistic the newpact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debtthe inra buffer stock manager might commit to his marketoperations.     malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a freerubber market because an inra had a tendency to keep prices atlevels that were only acceptable to consumers.    ""with the inras ability to keep prices at a certain stablelevel, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price,while producers may never see sharp price rises,"" a malaysianrubber producers council source told reuters.    producers also wanted a free rubber market without theoverhang of a 360,000 tonne inra buffer stock which hadpsychologically prevented price rises, he said.    state plantation officials in sri lanka said prices hadbeen depressed since inras inception and the creation of abuffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise.    sri lanka should not be a member of the inra because it wasexpensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added.    traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might bepressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential tostabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producersto produce more.    most malaysian and singapore traders said the new pactsconclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely toallow sharp price fluctuations in future.    ""the 360,000 tonnes in the inra buffer stock must beliquidated and a free market returned,"" a malaysian trader said.    japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for successas most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but theyquestioned the ability of some financially-strapped producersto finance buffer stock operations. reuter"

9892,alum,"aluminium scrap recovery and usage to risealuminium scrap recovery and usage andoutput of secondary metal will continue to rise, said shearsonlehman brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium marketwhich details cost and demand factors.    although primary smelting costs have declined generally inrecent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offeredby secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted materialincreasingly attractive.    it takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricityto produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, shearson said.    on the demand side, developments in automobiles andpackaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption.    automobile production, although expected to fall this year,is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for theforeseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castingsis gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry,particularly in the u.s.    in packaging, shearson does not expect aluminium todominate the beverage can market in any of the other majoreconomies to the extent it does in the u.s., but says there isevidence recycling is on the increase in other countries.    in addition to the cost savings involved, technologyadvances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced bythe secondary aluminium industry, shearson said.    there is not likely to be a problem of availability as theu.s. has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true ofseveral european countries, albeit on a smaller scale. reuter"
