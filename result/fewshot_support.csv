10268,tea,"india steps up countertrade deals to cut trade gapindia is searching for non-communistcountertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit andconserve foreign exchange.    wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering andelectronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, areall on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told reuters.    most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the state tradingcorp (stc) and the minerals and metals trading corp (mmtc).    ""the two state trading corporations are free to use theirbuying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote indianexports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding thatprivate firms are excluded from countertrading.    one trade source said india has targetted countries thatdepend on an indian domestic market recently opened to foreignimports.    however, countertrade deals still make up only a small partof indias total trading and are likely to account for lessthan eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in tradeduring the nine months ended december, the sources said.    countertrade accounted for just five pct of indias 25.65billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended march,against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.    however, the figures exclude exchanges with the easternbloc paid in non-convertible indian rupees, the sources said.    total trade with the soviet union, involving swaps ofagricultural produce and textiles for soviet arms and crudeoil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,against three billion in 1985/86.    indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to helpnarrow the countrys large trade deficit, is stillinsignificant compared with agreements reached by indonesia,venezuela and brazil, the trade sources said.    the trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billionin the current fiscal year.    but the push to include non-communist countries incountertrade is also due to other factors, including the slowgrowth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.    one source said india is showing more dynamism in promotingcountertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were madediscreetly because they break gatt rules. as a member of thegeneral agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt), india cannotofficially support bartering.    the mmtcs recent countertrade deals include iron oreexports to yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.    ""mmtcs recent global tenders now include a clause thatpreference will be given to parties who accept payment in kindfor goods and services sold to india,"" a trade official said,adding that the policy remains flexible.    ""we also take into account other factors such as prices atwhich the goods and services are offered to india,"" the tradeofficial said.    early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreigncompanies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigsand railway equipment to india that they stood a better chanceif they bought indian goods or services in return, the tradesources said.    illustrating the point, the official said a south koreanfirm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mlndlrs to the state-run oil and natural gas commission.    in return, the south koreans gave a verbal assurance to buyindian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pctsought by new delhi, the trade official said.    ""we selected the korean firm because its bid was the lowest,""he added.    countertrade is helping african countries short of foreigncurrency to import goods. india has signed a trade protocol tobuy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from zimbabwe inexchange for indian goods, including jute bags and cars.    but despite indias new drive, countertrade has someinherent problems, they added.    ""it is not always easy to meet the basic requirement thatthe trade should always be balanced,"" one trade source said. ""theother problem is it is often difficult to supply or buycommodities which the other party wants.""    another added, ""barter is also restrictive. we look upon itas a temporary measure to get over the current balance ofpayments difficulty.    ""this is why countertrade has not been made a law in india.it does not even figure in the countrys foreign trade policy."" reuter"

""it has been well established thathigh cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heartdisease,"" he said.    a malaysian oil palm growers council official, borgebek-nielsen, has said studies have shown that palm oil ischolesterol-free, low in saturated fats, has anti-cancerproperties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteriesin humans.    bek-nielsen said americans consume more saturated fatsdaily through food like butter, bacon, ham and beef than frompalm oil, which, he added is rich in vitamins a and e.    david kritchevsky, associate director of the wistarinstitute in philadelphia, appeared to take the asa view onlabelling. ""what people really have to learn is to read labels,""said kritchevsky. ""the more a consumer knows, the more likely hewill make an intelligent choice.""    the u.s. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm,palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels.    kritchevsky, a specialist in nutrition, said, ""moresaturated fat would raise cholesterol levels...so, from thatpoint of view its a health risk. high cholesterol levels inthe blood are a risk factor for heart disease.""    susanne harris, deputy assistant secretary of the u.s.agriculture departments food and consumer services division,said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils withhigh saturated fat levels was highest among those who haveheart disease.    the scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acidcontent of the tropical oils was saturated, whereas less than20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated.    david ericksen, director of asas technical services, saidu.s. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumerswere aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat.    imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of u.s.soybean sales in the u.s. market, asa estimates.    u.s. imports of coconut oil during january totaled 82.9 mlnlbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in december and 106.5 mln a yearearlier, according to commerce department figures.    imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3mln lbs in december and 85.2 mln a year earlier. reuter"

""the french corn growers will clearly charge ahead now andjust change corn to corn gluten feed"" in their complaint, halltold reuters.    a canadian government agency ruled today that u.s. farmpolicies are causing injury to canadian corn farrmers andsupported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85cts per bushel.    ""this was cleary a political decision,"" hall said. ""theamount of corn we export to canada is insignificant.""    the unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrumentthat canada bases its corn prices on u.s. futures prices andthat american farm policy has driven down these prices, thuscausing lower prices to canadian farmers and larger governmentpayments through its farm stabilization program, hall said.    hall said this is a new definition for injury, but thatother nations might also now apply this same argument to attacku.s. farm programs.    the french corn growers could now charge that u.s. farmprograms create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed, hallsaid. the french have long wanted to control the imports ofu.s. corn gluten feed into the community, saying that theimported feed was unfairly displacing european grain. reuter"

""growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not lookpromising as rice production is forecast to decline and theproduction of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or nogain,"" the report says.    ""the modest overall increase which is expected will be dueto significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oiland palm kernels.""    constraints to significant overall increases inagricultural output include a shortage of disease resistantseeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance byfarmers to shift from rice production to other crops, thereport underlines.    the fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak ofpests known as ""wereng"" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 whichlargely offset gains in yields.    the outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are nowresistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, moreresistant rice types.    the government is depending on increased production ofexport commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood andpalm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crudeoil prices.    palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pctin 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports risingto an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, thereport says.    but while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (oct-sept) willrise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports willalso rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.    the report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybeanmeal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of lastseptember""s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a risein domestic demand.    the report said that indonesia""s overall economicperformance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slightnegative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since themid-1960s. it compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pctin 1984.    the dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsiblefor the slump. reuter"
