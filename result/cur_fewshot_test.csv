10344,dfl,"economic spotlight - dutch exchange rate policyrecent slackness on dutch capitalmarkets has led some bankers to question the central bankspolicy of pegging the guilder firmly to the west german markand to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy.    while agreeing with the banks commitment to defend theguilder strongly, some bankers want the bank to make more useof the range within which the guilder and the mark canfluctuate against each other in the european monetary system(ems).    roelof nelissen, chairman of amsterdam-rotterdam bank nv(amro) said the central banks policy was overcautious.    ""i would like to suggest that the bank use more freely therange given to the guilder in the ems,"" nelissen said at thepresentation of amros 1986 annual report last week.    within the ems, the mark is allowed to fluctuate againstthe guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100.    the central bank maintains a stricter policy and tries tokeep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. it regards astable exchange rate as its main target, using interest ratepolicies to influence the exchange rate.    the preference of exchange rate goals above interest rateaims goes almost undisputed in the netherlands.    critics say the bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short.    rabobank nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: ""bymaintaining the 113.00 limit, the central bank raises theexpectation it will always intervene above that level. if itsuddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard toobtain.""    amros nelissen said relatively small changes in interestrates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows ofsecurities business and sharp fluctuations on the dutch capitalmarket. large interest rate changes were often needed to bringabout small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, headded.    unlike amro, algemene bank nederland nv (abn) says this isa price the dutch have to pay. it fully agrees with the centralbanks policy, director-general julien geertsema told reuters,noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully withthe mark in the ems hurt confidence in the dutch currency.    ""it is a pity we need such a wide interest rate differencebetween west germany to maintain the exchange rate,"" he added.    interest rate differentials between west germany and thenetherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flowsbetween the two countries, as the economic performance of thetwo does not differ much, economists said.    data on 1986 capital flows between west germany and thenetherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 theyaccounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the twocountries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by thedutch-german chamber of commerce earlier this month.    economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interestand exchange rates.    west germany is the netherlands largest single tradingpartner, taking 28 pct of dutch exports and providing 26 pct ofimports in the last quarter of 1986, central bureau ofstatistics figures show.    at the moment, the rates for three month euromark depositstrade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have arate of around 5-7/16 pct.    amro bank argues that the dutch real interest rate willeven rise further because of expectations of deflation here in1987, contrasting with slight inflation in west germany.    in the netherlands, the cost of living is expected todecrease by 1.5 pct at a gnp growth rate of two pct, the dutchcentral planning agency said in its 1987 forecast last month.german gnp is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflationbetween zero and 1.0 pct, according to most german forecasts.    but despite this upward push on real dutch rates, moneydealers do not expect the central bank to cut official ratesindependently without prior moves by the bundesbank.    following the west german interest rate cuts on january 22,the dutch central bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its creditsurcharge. most traders were surprised by this move as they hadexpected the bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said.    the bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impacton the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted.    while not entirely unsympathetic to critics of itspolicies, the central bank keeps its grip firm and the rangenarrow.    ""the european monetary system is not only a relationshipbetween the guilder and the mark. many times widening of themargin between the two would implicate we have to buy or selllarge amounts of a third currency,"" central bank vice-directorjan-hendrik du marchie sarvaas said.    ""if we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, themarkets would start to believe it was weak. we dont want that.we want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as themark,"" he said. reuter"

10617,dlr,"u.s. banker predicts further dollar fall this yeara leading u.s. banker said the dollarwas likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and animprovement in the huge american trade deficit would be onlytemporary at current world exchange rate levels.    kurt viermetz, worldwide treasurer of <morgan guarantytrust co>, told arab currency traders meeting here that thesteady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough torein in u.s. deficits on a lasting basis.    speaking at the 14th annual congress of the interarabcambist association, viermetz said an agreement reached lastmonth among major industrial nations to steady the dollararound current levels left many questions unanswered.    ""i cannot see any chance for a real turnaround (rise) in thedollar,"" viermetz said. ""i believe there is room for a furtherfall of five to 10 per cent in 1987.""    the united states, west germany, japan, france, greatbritain and canada -- g-6 -- agreed in paris in late februaryto stabilise major currencies around current levels.    the accord came after months of transatlantic argument,with tokyo and bonn claiming washingtons policy of talking thedollar lower had made life impossible for west german andjapanese exporters.    the paris accord also brought a pause to the continuedslide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in new york inseptember 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress thevalue of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances.    but viermetz said morgan guarantys economic models showedthat with no further change in exchange rates -- and continuedsluggish growth in west germany and japan -- the u.s. tradedeficit would improve only temporarily.    he said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs thisyear from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120billion in 1988 but by 1990, it would be back around 160billion dlrs.    ""this is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authoritiesand politicians in washington,"" he said.    viermetz said it was only natural that markets shouldattempt to test the credibility of the paris accord, struckwhen the dollar was trading at about 1.83 marks and 152.50 yen.    immediately before the historic 1985 new york agreement or""plaza accord,"" the dollar had been trading at 2.84 marks and 240yen.    viermetz said he believed major nations in paris wanted tosee the dollar hold within a ""loose range"" of 1.75 to 1.90 marksand 145 to 155 yen, with any attempt to push the u.s. currencylower being countered by central bank intervention.    the dollar ended in new york yesterday at 147.15/25 yen --its lowest level against the japanese currency in roughly 40years. it closed at 1.8160/70 marks.    viermetz also said he did not see the u.s. federal fundsrate falling below six pct for fear of provoking anuncontrolled fall in the dollar.    but at the same time, worries about the international debtcrisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world.    the middle east foreign exchange conference brings togethermore than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the arabworld and arab banks in european and u.s. financial centres.    formal discussions, which end today, have also centred onthe role of arab banks in world financial markets, with bankersurging them to adapt to a new global trend towardssecuritisation of  business.    hikmat nashashibi, president of the arab bankersassociation, said arab banks have to shake off their oldmentality of commercial banking and concentrate more oninvestment banking. reuter"

""the important implication of the maekawa report is that itis finally looking to let japanese enjoy the fruits of theirlabour,"" said philip caldwell, senior managing director ofshearson lehman brothers.    contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.    japanese officials say they are implementing the report asfast as they can, said a european ambassador who has travelledthe country asking about this issue.    he said people mentioned many things in line with thespirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal andsteel industries.    a major misunderstanding is that the private report wasgovernment policy. europeans are confused about this,underlined by von moltkes reference to the ""leadership"" of themaekawa report. even so, japanese officials point to lastseptembers government programme of new economic measures.""without endorsing the report as policy, officials point outthat the government has put its signature to a programmedesigned to implement the report,"" the ambassador said. reuter"

""it is clear that both germany and japan are havingdifficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rateappreciations and making their economies more domesticallyoriented, just as it is taking time for the united states tomake its own economy more export oriented,"" lawson said.    in his oral evidence to parliaments select treasurycommittee, lawson repeated that he was happy with the poundscurrent level, adding that ""it is an objective ... to try tokeep it around that level.""    he said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges hadchanged since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because thepound had weathered that period so successfully.

""so it would be beneficial to thecontinued conduct of our initiatives.""    but the official also said the administration would resistcalls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a targeteuropeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.    currency analysts believe the paris agreement set secret short-term target ranges for their currencies with a specificagreement to defend those bands with intervention.    according to market sources, the ranges agreed were 1.60 to1.90 marks to the dollar, and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar.    there is no official confirmation that specific bands  wereset, although the agreement used the term ""ranges"", for the firsttime in an international economic agreement.    the paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely tofoster currency stability around current levels.    last week, dealers said the federal reserve intervened tostop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached1.86 to the dollar. british authorities are also understood tohave intervened to curb sterlings strength.    international monetary sources say finance ministers andcentral bankers, who will review market performance and theirown economic prospects, will reassemble again in washingtonjust before the april 9 policymaking meeting of theinternational monetary fund.    the sources said italy, which refused to join the parispact, was invited back by treasury secretary james baker.    since paris, there are signs west german growth is slowing,while u.s. officials said they were giving japan until april toshow that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.    signs of concern about german prospects emerged recentlywhen bundesbank (central bank) president karl otto poehl toldbankers he would consider cutting west german interest rates ifthe fed was ready to follow suit.    a reagan administration official said this would show therehad been some change in approach on the part of the centralbank in germany.    but he declined to comment on the prospects for action bythe fed and the bundesbank.    ""if there is such a provision it is private and if i talkedabout it, it would no longer be private,"" said the official, whoasked not to be identified.    public comments by fed officials suggest the central bankis keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if themajor economies continue to show sluggish growth and the u.s.trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinatedaction could be on the april agenda. reuter"

""the measures to take effect by june were designed to liftrestrictions on foreign currency operations, in line withderegulation in the banking industry,"" he said in a telephoneinterview.    the spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controlshighlighted a broader package of reforms announced last friday.    the central bank said in a statement the measures includedincreased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provisionfor future pension fund obligations.    it said the measures were the latest steps to deregulatespains financial sector, a move triggered by entry into thecommunity last year.    spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, aprocess that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreignbanks to open branches.    since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market andthey now control about 15 pct of the systems lending assets.    residents in spain can now borrow freely in foreigncurrency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against aprevious ceiling of 750 mln pesetas.    the 750 mln peseta limit was set last march. between thatdate and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into thecountry on new foreign currency loans.    the central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billionpesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would begiven clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days.    spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreigncurrency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, byissuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper.    they can also employ these funds to invest in foreignissues, while before they had to be converted into deposits.    foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies,instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency.    the central bank has also lifted the restriction on theamount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limitedto three times a banks capital equity.    the latest deregulation measures were welcomed by mostbankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month whichimposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible pesetafunds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates.    the reserve requirement, which was already in place onnormal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreignspeculative capital which is entering the country andthreatening the governments money supply growth target.    a foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which nowaccount for about 30 pct of deposits, placed spanish banks at adisadvantage with european competitors.    the government reduced fixed asset investment requirementsto 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact ofinterest rate deregulation. ""the real problem is the freeing ofinterest rates,"" the banker said. ""this is going to take a bigbite out of profits.""    the ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paidon deposits of up to 180 days.    the chairman of one of spains leading banks said themeasure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits thisyear. reuter"
5778,dlr,"dollar seen falling unless japan spurs economyunderlying dollar sentiment is bearish,and operators may push the currency to a new low unless japantakes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the parisaccord, foreign exchange analysts polled by reuters said here.    ""the dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,"" a senior dealerat one leading bank said.    the dollar has eased this week, but remains stable ataround 151.50 yen. six major industrial countries agreed at ameeting in paris in february to foster currency stability.    some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term,but a drastic fall is unlikely because of u.s. fears of renewedinflation and fears of reduced japanese purchases of u.s.treasury securities, needed to finance the u.s. deficit.    dealers generally doubted whether any economic packagejapan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce itstrade surplus significantly, and said such measures wouldprobably invite further u.s. steps to weaken the dollar.    under the paris accord, tokyo promised a package ofmeasures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boostdomestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus.    but debate on the budget has been delayed by an oppositionboycott of parliamentary business over the proposed impositionof a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slimchance of producing a meaningful economic package in the nearfuture, the dealers said.    if no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in theu.s. congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure onthe dollar, they said.    the factors affecting the u.s. currency have not changedsince before the paris accord, they added.    ""underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due toa still-sluggish u.s. economic outlook, the international debtcrisis triggered by brazils unilateral suspension of interestpayments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of thereagan administration as a result of the iran/contra armsscandal,"" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank.    ""there is a possibility that the dollar may decline toaround 140.00 yen by the end of this year,"" said chemical banktokyo branch vice president yukuo takahashi.    but operators find it hard to push the dollar either wayfor fear of possible concerted central bank intervention.    dealers said there were widespread rumours that the u.s.federal reserve telephoned some banks in new york to ask forquotes last wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollarwhen it rose to 1.87 marks.    the bank of england also apparently sold sterling in londonwhen it neared 1.60 dlrs on wednesday, they said.    but other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of centralbank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollars declinebecause many dealers are likely to await such dollar buyingintervention as a chance to sell dollars.    however, first national bank of chicago tokyo branchassistant manager hiroshi mochizuki said ""the dollar will notshow drastic movement at least to the end of march.""    other dealers said the u.s. seems unwilling to see anystrong dollar swing until japanese companies close their booksfor the fiscal year ending on march 31, because a weak dollarwould give japanese institutional investors paper losses ontheir foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest inpurchases of u.s. treasury securities.    u.s. monetary officials may refrain from making anycomments this month to avoid influencing rates, they said. reuter"

""japanese corporations have been actively setting up theirfinancing companies in london, suggesting they increasingly areengaging in, not only fund raising, but management there,""dezuka said.    the steep increase in the number of branches of japanesesecurities houses in london and the growing numbers of u.s. andu.k. brokers coming to tokyo has helped the london marketsgrowth, dealers said.    internationalisation of the yen is also likely to bepromoted by yen bond trading in chicago and new york later thisyear, securities managers said.    the recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the u.s.securities and exchange commission will allow the cbot to applyto the commodity futures trading commission for a yen bondfutures contract, they said.    the ruling removed a regulation which prohibited tradingfutures of designated foreign government debt securities notlocated in the issuing country.    fundamental brokers inc, a major u.s. brokers broker, hasdecided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in newyork as early as april.    cbots start of an evening session, planned for the end ofapril, will also multiply yen bond futures trading, a nomurasecurities co ltd bond manager said. but there are stillobstacles to trading on the london market.

12136,dlr,"currency intervention timing crucial - analyststhe dollars recent decline, despitemassive central bank purchases, is a forceful reminder thatofficial intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only ifit is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentalsor sentiment, dealers and analysts said.    central banks may succeed in slowing a trend, but, withoutaccompanying policy changes, they stand little chance ofreversing the direction of an ever-growing global market inwhich more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day, thesources said.    ""timing and psychology are the key to successfulintervention,"" said jim oneill, a financial markets economistwith marine midland banks inc. the importance of complementarychanges in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday whena change in interest rates boosted the dollar, instantlyachieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for aweek through open market intervention.    after citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to7-3/4 pct, the first change in the rate since last august, thedollar started to advance and reached a high in tokyo of 147.50yen, up two yen from tuesdays new york low.    by contrast, monetary authorities spearheaded by the bankof japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billiondlrs in the last 10 days of march but could not prevent thedollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year lowmonday of 144.70 yen. some experts worry the central banks havelost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar.the market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a centralbank foray, but is no longer mesmerized.    ""theyve lost their credibility. the market feels it cantake on the central banks and win,"" said michael snow, head oftreasury operations at union bank of switzerland in new york.    the relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharpcontrast to the success that central banks scored when theyjoined forces to drive the dollar down following the september22, 1985, plaza accord.    then, however, central banks had an easy time of it,because the markets and the treasuries of the major industrialpowers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower toredress massive worldwide trade imbalances.    now, there is no such consensus. the market is saying thatthe dollar must fall further because the u.s. trade deficit isshowing little sign of improvement, while japan is resisting ina bid to protect its export industries.    for its part, the united states is apparently content tolet the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little morethan lip service to the february paris agreement of the groupof five plus canada to foster stability, dealers say.    specifically, they said the feds dollar-buyingintervention has been half-hearted, designed more as apolitical gesture to japan than to strike fear into themarkets. ""its been pro-forma intervention,"" said francoisesoares-kemp, chief corporate trader at credit lyonnais.    because of this discord and the markets momentum for alower dollar, analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail.    ""its going to take a lot more than the central banks tohold the dollar (at these levels),"" said snow, who predictsanother 10 to 15 pct depreciation.    ""there have to be structural changes that occur to make themarket stop selling dollars,"" added ""buying six billion dollarsin three weeks is not going to do it.""    late last decade during the presidency of jimmy carter,when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack,central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billiondlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollarfalling to a record low of 1.70 marks, analysts said.    snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely. ""idont think anybody has the stomach for it, because they sawthe futility of it in the seventies.""    indeed, because the market has grown in leaps and boundsince then, intervention on an even greater scale wouldprobably be needed to impress the market.    trading volume in london, new york and tokyo alone lastyear averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day, according to ajoint central bank study, about double the previous estimatemade just two years earlier by the group of thirty privateresearch group.    there are signs that central banks, too, realize thefutility of swimming against the tide.    bank of japan sources told reuters in tokyo earlier thisweek that they believed the limits of currency marketintervention are perhaps being reached and that other methodsfor bolstering the dollar, such as invoking currency swapagreements with other central banks, are being considered.

12337,dlr,"further declines in u.s. debt futures possibleafter an already steep fall in the pastweek, u.s. interest rate futures may be in for further declinesin the near term, financial analysts said.    however, some analysts said recent sharp losses in bondfutures have left the bond market somewhat oversold, and thecontracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery beforeresuming their decline.    key to the near-term direction of futures will be thecourse of the dollar, they said.    ""as the dollar goes, so goes the bond market,"" said deanwitter analyst karen gibbs.    the recent decline in the dollar, which hit a 40-year lowagainst the japanese yen monday, was reversed wednesday whenseveral large u.s. money center banks unexpectedly raised theirprime lending rates by a quarter point, to 7-3/4 pct.    ""even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar,foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar declineis over,"" gibbs said.    the dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debtfutures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation.    indeed, the falling dollar may have been a key topic at themeeting of the federal reserves policy making arm, the federalopen market committee, this week, analysts said.    ""to the fed, the combination of a falling dollar, asteepening yield curve, and rising commodity prices looksuspiciously like the traces of expectations of acceleratinginflation,"" said denis karnosky, analyst at carroll, mcenteeand mcginley inc.    such expectations could mean that ""a shift in policy towardrestriction of bank reserves is likely to get very seriousconsideration,"" at the fomc meeting, he said.    any such restriction of reserves will not be a highlyvisible form of monetary tightening, karnosky said.    rather, the key to detecting a change will be found inseasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window, hesaid. borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mlndlrs over the past several months, he said.    in the meantime, however, ""the market looks a bitoversold,"" said jim wysoglad, analyst at golden gate futures.    wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition coulddrive june bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to testchart support near the recent low of 97-13/32.    technician leslie keefe of technical data corp of bostonsaid that the key test for june bonds will be whether thenearby contract holds above chart support at 96-24/32.    ""all previous selloffs since mid-november have stopped andbuyers have surfaced at that level,"" keefe said.    if that level is broken, and the dollar continues todecline, keefe said she expects the june bond contract todecline to test support between 92 and 93, the primary uptrendline dating back to 1984. reuter"

""it would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of anelection ... i dont believe lawson is mad enough to tiehimself to a fixed rate,"" brett said.    currency markets were keen for official statements toclarify the scope of the paris accord and reactivate currencytrading. this mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said.    ""making similar statements when the market is high strungand ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake,"" one senior dealerwith a u.s. bank said.    capels skeoch said, ""it gives the foreign exchange marketssomething to shoot at.""    ""it is obvious that the government, as a member of the groupof six, has agreed exchange rate bands. but they are not cut instone, they can change with time,"" skeoch said.    brett said, ""we think the 2.90 marks level is a centralrate. give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine.""    not all analysts played down the significance of theremarks, however. chris dunn, economist at royal bank ofcanada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulatesterling from the fortunes of the dollar.    although about two-thirds of britains trade is conductedwith european countries, sterling has traditionally shadowedthe dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted.    ""britain must decide whether it wants to follow the u.s. orthrow in its lot with europe,"" dunn said.    ""it suggests that while the u.k. is not actually applying tojoin the european monetary system, it is seeking protection byshadowing it ... the bundesbank has made it clear that it wantsthe u.k. to clarify its position relative to the mark,"" he said.    analysts said sterlings dip on currency markets followinglawsons remarks made an early half-point cut in u.k. baserates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term.    ""over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get someextremely good economic indicators,"" capels skeoch said.    base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in march,the last after the march 17 budget presentation, and analystshad been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards. reuter"

""it was a definite hint at lower german interest rates,"" saidone banker who attended the symposium.    a bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have nocomment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting.    but, according to a second source, who also declined to beidentified, poehls comments were seen by bankers present as adirect pointer to further moves by the central bank to defendgerman industry from an additional revaluation of the mark.    ""he said if the americans drop their interest rates then thebundesbank would also drop them. he said that quite clearly,""the second source said.    in reply to questions, poehl also said the half-point cutin the discount and lombard rates on january 22 came after theu.s. had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting todiscuss the level of the dollar on condition germany made sucha move in advance, the sources said.    asked if american authorities could have been persuaded, bycuts in german rates, to come to the bargaining table as earlyas last september, one of the sources quoted poehl as saying,""no, they wouldnt have been. we checked that.""    the paris meeting of the group of six industrial nationstook place exactly one month after the german cut in rates.    poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talksbetween central banks before and after the g-6 meeting, sayingthat financial markets had not fully realised the significanceof the paris session and the u.s. agreement to stem furtherfalls in the value of the dollar, the sources said.    for the first time all participants at the summit agreedthat a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for allworld economies, including the u.s., poehl had said.    the sources said the tone of poehls comments boostedgrowing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised aroundcurrent levels by international central bank cooperation.    one source said poehls remarks also underlined the factthat the bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodativein monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown inwest germanys economic growth.    poehl and other bundesbank officials have in the paststressed that the german central bank had no directresponsibility for growth and was solely concerned withcombatting inflation.    this led, for instance, to the introduction of a tightermonetary stance from the beginning of december until thehalf-point cut in rates in late january.    the sources quoted poehl as saying that the currentovershooting of the german monetary target would not directlyrespark inflation. the bundesbank was not obliged to reactimmediately whenever such overshooting occurs.    latest data for central bank money stock, the bundesbanksmain measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at7-1/2 pct in january, outside its three to six pct 1987 target.    share prices rose in very active trading today, withdealers reporting that poehls remarks, coupled with a bullishoutlook on stock prices from deutsche at the same symposium,brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels. reuter"

""you have to look at the dollars peak compared with now,and that was well before plaza,"" he said.    on february 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at263.15 yen. on september 20, the friday before plaza, it was242. since then, despite massive bank of japan intervention andperiodic market frights about further g-5 concerted action, thedollar trend has been down, down, down.    yet the ecu is now around 173.4 yen. the historical crossrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. theeuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.    the close relationship between exchange rates and tradeflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, butundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three ischanging. in 1986, japanese imports and exports with the ecboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.this gave japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.    last january, japanese exports to the ec totalled half ofof sales to the u.s, against about a third in recent years.    trade with the u.s in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exportsand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.    ""the basic meaning for europe is that japanese firms have atremendous interest in exporting to europe, where every unitsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is importantto them. suddenly, instead of the u.s., it is europe that islaying the golden egg,"" said de hora.    the ec is worried. ec business also had a remarkable yearin japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to itsstart from a small base, compared with total japan-u.s. trade.    the japanese think ec firms are now more competitive thanu.s. firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rateimbalance, and which will cause problems.

14770,dlr,"poehl warns against further dollar fallbundesbank president karl otto poehlsaid a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciationof the mark would damage prospects for sustained west germaneconomic growth.    in a speech to the institute of contempory german affairshere, poehl said ""it would be an extremely risky policy to aimfor a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar tocorrect the trade deficit.""    he said the united states could face a vicious circle ofdepreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took thatroute.    poehl noted west germany had already taken steps to meetu.s. demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and toleratingabove-target money supply growth.    he said he would have been happy to have brought forwardfive billion marks of tax cuts now planned for january 1988 tothe beginning of this year, but he said the government facedpolitical constraints getting such measures through the upperhouse of the west german parliament.    but there were also limits to the impact west germany couldaccept on exports from a rising mark, he said.    poehl said west germany relied on exports for aboutone-third of its gross national product, so a substantialerosion of export markets could not be offset by increasingdemand at home.    ""a further appreciation of the mark could even be anobstacle to further growth,"" he said.    poehl said the bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supplygrowth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation andbecause external factors, including low oil prices andfavourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.    but poehl said west germany now faced a difficult dilemmaover monetary policy.    the underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not thereported negative inflation rates last year, and west germanywas affected more than before by exchange rate developments.    ""for the time being, we will have to focus our policy moreon the external side, and we can live with a more expansionarymoney supply. but we must be very careful,"" he said.    he said he shared some of the u.s. concern about japanstrade surpluses, which affected european countries as well asthe united states.    poehl welcomed the so-called louvre accord of monetaryofficials of major industrialized countries, saying theimportance of the february 22 agreement to stabilize exchangerates had been underestimated.    all partners had agreed that the dollar was at about theright level, and that further changes would damage growth, hesaid.    ""this was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on thepart of our american colleagues,"" he said.    but he said there was still a danger that the correction ofthe dollars value could overshoot. reuter"

8884,stg,"sterling outlook clouded by test of paris accordthe move by foreign exchange markets totest the strength of the paris currency accord has thrown intoquestion the near-term outlook for sterling, until recently oneof the main beneficiaries of the agreement, analysts said.    since the six-nation accord last month, sterling has risensharply, adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index.    while the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen anddollar/mark movements, the markets turned their attention tosterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage ofrelatively high u.k. interest rates.    but analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the firsttentative test of the paris accord seen yesterday.    the market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollardown further in a test of the willingness of central banks tointervene. analysts say if the banks do not interveneeffectively, the paris accord could collapse.    ""on balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if g-6collapses,"" phillips and drew analyst stephen lewis said.    he said sterling would lose out as markets turned theirattention to capital movements whereas previously they had beenrestricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies.    however, although most analysts and foreign exchangedealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation oreven retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharpdrop in the u.k. currency.    sterling remained supported by optimism on the u.k.political and economic outlook, firmer oil prices andrelatively high interest rates, they said.    bullish sentiment on the u.k. economic outlook has beenrunning especially high after last weeks budget, seen aspopular both with the markets and with british voters.    sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in thewest german and japanese economies, where growth for 1987 istrailing behind the three pct forecast for the u.k.    recent opinion polls showing britains ruling conservativeparty ahead of opposition parties in popularity have alsosupported the pound.    in addition, sterling has so far shrugged off twohalf-point cuts in u.k. bank base lending rates in less thantwo weeks. a further half-point cut, widely expected in thenext week or so, has already been largely discounted.    u.k. base rates, now running at 10 pct, are stillrelatively high compared to other western countries, andanalysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikelyto affect sterling.    sterling today appeared resilient to the dollars decline,dropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis.    worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchangemarkets, however, were reflected in the u.k. government bond(gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point.    until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market hasbeen one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling.    dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steadyfor the next few days while the market awaits furtherdevelopments on the dollar and this thursdays u.k. currentaccount figures for february.    market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stgafter januarys small surplus. reuter"

""the market can be bigger than the central banks. andeconomic fundamentals will always come to the fore,"" said adealer at one major u.s. bank.    as the dollar dropped to post-world war ii lows against theyen today foreign exchange traders said the bank of japan,federal reserve board and bank of england intervened in themarkets on behalf of the u.s. currency.    reports of the authorities actions helped the dollarrecover to about 149.45 yen in new york this afternoon fromthe post-war low of 148.20 yen in the far east. but it stillfailed to regain mondays u.s. closing level of 150.00/05 yen.    tokyo dealers said the bank of japan bought one to 1.5billion dlrs in tokyo today and may also have purchased dollarsyesterday in the u.s. via the federal reserve.    meanwhile, there were strong rumors in new york that thefed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yentoday. talk also circulated that the bank of england purchaseda small amount of dollars for yen.    the feds last confirmed intervention was on january 28when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the bank ofjapan. but on march 11 the fed also was rumored to havesignalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks.    the authorities actions appeared to back up the february22 paris pact between the u.s., japan, west germany, britain,france and canada under which the nations agreed to cooperateto foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels.    but foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed bythe authorities intervention which they said can only softenextreme moves in the market.    for one thing, some dealers believed that the fedspurchases were done on behalf of the bank of japan rather thanfor the u.s. central banks own account, suggesting a rather  watered-down american commitment to the currency accord.    the bank of englands action also was thought to becompleted on behalf of the japanese central bank, reinforcingthe markets view that japan is the most resolute of the sixnations in its support of the currency pact.    ""no-one doubts the bank of japan is serious. but the othertwo central banks seem to be making more token gestures thananything else,"" said chris bourdain of bankamerica corp.    ""im not convinced the intervention was concerted,"" saidearl johnson of harris trust and savings bank in chicago. ""its a yen problem more than anything else.""    some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionistsentiment in the u.s. limits the extent to which the americanauthorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen.    ""the dollars break below the key 150 yen level ties thetreasurys hands behind its back. the u.s. cannot intervene onits own account because of the strength of protectionism here,""said albert soria of swiss bank corp.    such comments reflect the view that the currency marketsare becoming increasingly politicized. despite officialdenials, some traders still feel the u.s. would countenance alower dollar to help trim the nations trade deficit.    the majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise tradedeficit in 1986 was with japan.    indeed u.s. treasury secretary james bakers comment onsunday that the february currency pact had not establisheddollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell theu.s. currency and kicked off the latest retreat.    ""the dollar still has more room on the downside against theyen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. thecurrency market is becoming very political,"" said natsuo okadaof sumitomo bank ltd.    okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yenthis week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the endof april or early may.    even if west germany and japan succeed in stimulating theireconomies, it may not be enough to solve structural economicimbalances in the near future, dealers said.    ""even if japan and west germany do expand this year, itwont be enough to help the trade situation much,"" saidbourdain of bankamerica, who also expects the dollar to drop to148 yen in the next couple of days. reuter"

9170,saudriyal,"middle east currency market sees key changesmiddle east currency dealers meet inabu dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in theirbusiness, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift fromthe arab world to london.    the 14th congress of the inter-arab cambiste associationalso comes at a time when the prospect of a unified gulfcurrency system is more real that at any time this decade.    foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said theseissues, and the slide of the lebanese pound, can be expected tobe major talking points.    about 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks --including some in london and other major non-arab financialcentres -- are expected to attend the conference which beginson on saturday.    bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that agrowing proportion of transactions in the saudi riyal market,by far the largest in the region, is being carried out inlondon.    the market had been dominated by saudi arabias 11 banks,foreign exchange houses in the kingdom and offshore banks inbahrain. but bankers said more and more saudi and bahrain-basedbanks are boosting their treasury operations in london.    as recession hit the middle east and the need for tradefinance in the region declined, many offshore banks in bahrainran down their currency operations. none of the four major u.k.clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island.    the two major bahrain-based international banks, <arabbanking corp> and <gulf international bank bsc> have increasedtheir presence in london and saudi banks are busy upgradingrepresentative offices to branch status to allow dealing.    one economist said: ""it is cheaper to run a riyal book inlondon than staff an expensive offshore operation in bahrain...there is now the nucleus of a two-way market in london.""    jeddah-based <riyad bank> set up as a licensed deposittaker in london in 1984, while its main rival in saudi arabia,<national commercial bank> (ncb) won a licence in november1986.    the major market maker has traditionally been london-basedconsortium bank <saudi international bank> but the kingdomjoint-venture <saudi american bank> (samba) also upgraded itslondon operation to deposit taker status in mid-february.    one senior currency trader in riyadh said: ""inevitably thevolume of business in london has gained pace with the two newlicences for ncb and samba, but there is no question that mostof the liquidity still rests in saudi arabia.""    currency traders said the shift to london in the saudiriyal market is difficult to quantify.    bahrain monetary agency figures show regional currencydeposits held by offshore banks, most in saudi riyals, droppedto the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-september 1986from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion.    the shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. riyaltrading in the gulf on saturdays and sundays has become veryquiet with london closed while some saudi and bahrain banks nowstaff offices on friday, the gulf weekend. traders also expect<arab national bank> to step up london operations.    traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal marketmoving completely out of the region, partly because of localdemand and partly because of what is seen as the saudi arabianmonetary agencys (sama) desire to moderateinternationalisation of the riyal and protect it from unduespeculation.    there have been far fewer signs of the kuwaiti dinar marketshifting from its natural base of kuwait and trading in bahrainand london is still limited.    but for the first time since the formation of the sixnation gulf cooperation council (gcc) in 1981 there are signsthat a much mooted currency union could come into force soon.    currency traders said it remains unclear what form a finalcurrency union would take for the six states -- saudi arabia,kuwait, bahrain, oman, qatar and the united arab emirates.    but plans to link the six currencies in a european monetarysystem style with a common peg have been discussed at highlevel and could be a topic on the gccs annual summit expectedto be held in saudi arabia late in the year.    one dealer said: ""a lot of exposure is being given todiscussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. but in theend a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.""    one open question is that of a common peg for currencies.    the idea of linking the six currencies has been debatedsince the start of the gcc. the kuwaiti dinar is currentlylinked to a basket of currencies while the other fivecurrencies are either officially or in practice linked to theu.s. dollar.    some traders said a currency union could mean speculationagainst the saudi riyal rubbing off on other gulf currencies,but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.    another topic for debate is expected to be the continuedslide of the lebanese pound against the dollar and theundermining of the effective capital base of lebanese banks. reuter"

9848,stg,"u.k. trade figures buoy hopes of interest rate cutthe release of u.k. february trade datashowing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in january, has boosted hopesof an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.    market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, withexpectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharplynarrower than januarys 527 mln deficit.    ""the figures are unreservedly good,"" chase manhattansecurities economist andrew wroblewski said.    sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weakermorning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted indexagainst a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged fromyesterdays close but 0.3 points above the 1100 gmt level.    the market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil tradepattern would undermine international support for sterling,which has been the motor behind the recent fall in u.k.interest rates. money market sources said the market had begunto doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending ratesto 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.    but sentiment now looks to have turned about again.    there now looks to be no danger that the chancellor of theexchequer nigel lawsons forecast of a 1987 current accountdeficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said wroblewski.    seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose infebruary to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in january.    exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.    however, chris tinker, u.k. analyst at brokers phillips anddrew said that the faster rise in exports than imports wouldprove partly aberrational in coming months. he forecast thechancellors budget tax cuts would increase consumer expeditureon imported goods.    however, ian harwood, economist at warburg securities, saidhis firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficitforecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billionstg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.    he said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goodsconfirmed recent bullish surveys among members of theconfederation of british industry.    the growth in imports appears to be flattening, even ifjanuarys bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseasgoods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres,harwood said.    u.k. government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worriesabout the figures evaporated.    sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settlingto a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 gmt, nearly a cent higherthan the european low of 1.5960.    however, analysts noted that the turnabout in marketsentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.    morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market waslargely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that theconservative governments support was slipping.    the marplan poll, published in ""today,"" showed conservativesupport had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while thealliance of liberals and social democrats had rallied to 31pct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the labour party,whose own support fell from 38 pct.    the poll was taken after the budget, which was greetedenthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have leftthe voters indifferent, political observers said.    another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warnthat todays improved sentiment could be dented if support forprime minister margaret thatcher slips again.    this upsetting of the markets political perceptions, whichare all but discounting a conservative victory in the upcominggeneral election, made them more sensitive to the trade data,harwood said. ""the news did come as a very, very substantialrelief,"" he said.    however, on the interest rate front, economists cautionthat lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable byencouraging another base rate fall. they noted lawson hadalready got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates inresponse to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons forlower rates have been curtailed. reuter"
