""one way or another, we will force our major tradingpartners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correctthe mounting u.s. trade deficit, chronowitz said.    ""i think the markets believe, and have believed for a longtime, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. itsgoing to be a long and tedious process, but thats whatshappening,"" he said.    the falling value of the dollar makes u.s. commoditiescheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.    at the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bondssaw the value of their investments falling and many are turningto commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said martymcneill, a metals analyst in new york with the trading house ofdominick and dominick.    the reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughoutthe commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cottonposted broad gains.    traders at the chicago board of trade said attention in thegrain markets has shifted from concern about burdensomesupplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulateexport demand.    after the close of trading, the agriculture departmentraised its estimate for grain imports by the soviet union bytwo mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.    live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on thechicago mercantile exchange, while live cattle were moderatelyhigher.    analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. they saidhogs havent been making the weight gains that are normal atthis time of year, and farmers have been too busy with fieldwork to market animals. reuter"

"['interest', 'money-fx', 'dlr']",16053,test,yes,analysts doubt fed firmed despite borrowing rise,"economists said that they doubt thefederal reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despitehigher discount window borrowings in the latest two-weekstatement period and very heavy borrowings wednesday.    data out today show net borrowings from the fed averaged393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to wednesday, up from 265 mlndlrs in the prior statement period. wednesday borrowings were1.4 billion dlrs as federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.    ""one could make a case that the fed is firming, but itprobably isnt,"" said william sullivan of dean witter reynolds.    sullivan said some may assume the fed has firmed policymodestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in thetwo-weeks to wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averagingaround 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.    however, the dean witter economist noted that the latesttwo-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demandoften pushes up borrrowings.    ""some might argue that the fed was firming policy, but itlooks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisionslate in the statement period and didnt quite make it,"" saidward mccarthy of merrill lynch capital markets.    a fed spokesman told a press press conference today thatthe fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs ormore in its reserve projections in the week ended wednesday.    still, mccarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss inits estimates over the week that caused it to add fewerreserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.    the fed took no market reserve management action lastthursday and friday, the first two days of the week. it addedtemporary reserves indirectly on monday via two billion dlrs ofcustomer repurchase agreements and then supplied reservesdirectly via system repurchases on tuesday and wednesday.    based on fed data out today, economists calculated that thetwo-day system repurchase agreements the fed arrranged ontuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. they put wednesdaysovernight system repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.    ""it is quite clear that the fed is not firming policy atthis time,"" said larry leuzzi of s.g. warburg and co inc.    citing the view shared by the other two economists, leuzzisaid the fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interestrates to help the dollar because that would harm already weakeconomies in the united states and abroad and add to thefinancial stress of developing countries and their lenders.    ""those who believe the fed tightened policy in the lateststatement period have to explain why it acted before the dollartumbled,"" said mccarthy of merrill lynch.    he said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a newstatement period began today on disappointment yesterdayswashington meetings of international monetary officials failedto produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.    in fact, currency dealers said there was nothing inwednesdays g-7 communique to alter the prevailing view thatthe yen needs to rise further to redress the huge tradeimbalance between the united states and japan.    the economists generally agreed that the fed is aiming forsteady policy now that should correspond to a weekly averagefed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. this is about wherethe rate has been since early november.    ""im not so sure that the fed is engineering a tighterpolicy to help the dollar, as some suspect,"" said sullivan ofdean witter.    if it is, however, he said that fed probably has justnudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct fromsix to 6.10 pct previously. reuter"

""volckers been saying for a long time that a dollarfreefall would be extremely dangerous - now hes got it,"" saiddavid jones, economist at aubrey g. lanston and co inc.    the dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in40 years as the group of seven finance ministers in washingtonfailed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have acredible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, shortof further depreciation of the dollar.    bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amidworries that the dollars slide will rekindle inflation, scareaway foreign investors and force the fed to tighten credit.    the inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spikein interest rates pulled the dow jones industrial average downby 33 points to 2339.    norman robertson, mellon bank chief economist, called themarkets instability frightening. he believes economicfundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that ""onceyou start the ball rolling its difficult to stop.""    ""theres a stark possibility that you could get adestabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest ratesand drives us into recession. the markets are in a panic.""    stephen marris of the institute for international economicsin washington, has been warning for a long time that thecontrolled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and264 yen in february 1985 could turn into a nightmare.    ""were still more or less on track for a hard landing... butthe agony may be fairly drawn out,"" marris told reuters.    marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later thisyear, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that itwould take very little to touch off what he calls the secondphase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in thedollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.    the stock markets reaction today and its sharp drop onmarch 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.    the fact that it has not happened yet is consistent withhistorical experience, which teaches that domestic markets arenot affected until a currency is in the final stages of itsdecline, marris said. he has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.    marris felt that a major impetus for the dollars latestweakness was the loss of credibility that central bankssuffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from fallingbelow 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set aspart of the g-7 paris agreement in february.    robertson at mellon, by contrast, said the loss ofconfidence was triggered last week when washington announcedplans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on japanese electronicimports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.    many economists believe that long-run stability will notreturn to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap isaddressed - excessive consumption in the u.s., reflected in themassive budget deficit.    but in the short term, given the failure of the g-7 and ofcentral bank intervention, some feel that the fed will have nochoice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.    ""the only thing that will stop the dollar falling is asubstantial increase in the discount rate and a correspondingcut abroad, at least by japan,"" said lanstons jones.    marris expects the fed to act quickly to raise interestrates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden foramerican farmers, latin american governments and others.    but robert giordano, chief economist at goldman sachs andco, scoffed at the notion. ""its ridiculous to think the federalreserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weakagainst just one currency. this is yen strength, not dollarweakness,"" he said.    giordano said the market was ignoring the progress beingmade toward reducing the u.s. budget deficit.

""we need a stock index futures contract, and a futurescontract for recent government bonds,"" one dealer said.    west germany now has options contracts on about five pct ofshares and bonds traded on exchanges here, covering only about30 pct of the average traded volume, stock market sources said.    options can only be written on the original 14 bondsselected when bond options were introduced last april. the mostrecent bond on the list was issued in 1985.    there are no futures exchanges in west germany. germanbanks may participate in futures exchanges through branchesabroad but these are at least outwardly subject to stringentwest german rules requiring that every contract be secured on aone-by-one basis with a separate hedge, to prevent speculation.    another problem is a lack of liquidity in the existingmarkets, owing to lack of private investor participation.    private individuals and corporations do not engage inoptions trading now due to west germanys civil and exchangelaws, which define losses made in futures and options businessas gambling losses, which investors need not pay back.    options business has been hurt by lack of liquidity frompension funds, which currently are forbidden to invest in theseinstruments. but they are to be allowed to enter the businesssoon as the european community begins to harmonize rulesgoverning funds.    manfred laux, general secretary of the west german mutualfunds association in frankfurt, said harmonized rules are to beadopted by october 1, 1989 at the latest.    the push to adopt new instruments has not been great in thepast, owing to wide-spread belief they are speculative, whichgives them a bad name in west germany. but pressure for theirintroduction here is growing.    the start-up of a swiss futures exchange has some bankersconsidering if a similar exchange would be useful in westgermany. they say that without innovations, some business coulddrift to london, which the bundesbank vehemently opposes.    an official at the london international financial futuresexchange (liffe) said the exchange currently has no plans tointroduce more mark-denominated contracts beyond the existingmark-dollar contract. but he said the exchange is studying thefeasibility of other contracts, including one for three-monthmark interest rates and possibly a government bond contract.    a bundesbank capital markets expert said the bundesbank hasno objections to hedging through futures but any liberalizationin that sector is still in the early planning stages afterearlier talks ended two years ago.    considerations about the futures business have been drawnout because of the large number of participants involved intalks. they include parliament, the bundesbank, the federalbanking supervisory board, eight west german stock exchangesand their governing states, and the four west german bankingassociations.    beyond options and futures, other changes being suggestedinclude replacing the federal governments current bondconsortium with an auction procedure similar to one beingconsidered in the u.k. and already in practice in the u.s.    this would upset the existing market order providing germanand foreign banks in the consortium with fixed quotas but itwould eliminate the misallocations some bankers say presentlyarise within the fixed consortium quota system.    in addition, some bankers would like the method of bondtrading on the west german stock exchange changed to a systemof continuous price-setting from the current system in whichevery bond price is fixed once a day.    this would make trading more transparent if it reduced theproportion of off-floor interbank bond trading, now some 90 pctof the volume of bond transactions here, the bankers say. reuter"

""it (the mtnmarket) will even surpass the bond market,"" he said.    other bankers took exception with the degree to which mtnswill grow. but they generally agreed that these instrumentsprovide the borrower with greater flexibility and lower coststhan a traditional bond.    the trick is in convincing european borrowers it is wortharranging a program and, having accomplished that, to persaudeeuropean investors -- whose preferences differ from their u.s.counterparts -- to buy the securities.    discussions with bankers proved one thing. no one isexactly sure how to proceed with structuring and marketingthese issues.    to date only 13 euro-mtn programs have been announced butonly a few have been activated, such as those for a unit ofpepsico inc and another for ab electrolux.    several firms have devised different structures foreuro-mtns and defend their structures adamantly.    the pepsico notes, for example, are sold on a continuouslyoffered basis. this involves a small amount of new notes withsimilar maturities constantly on offer at current market rates.    the electrolux program uses multi-tranche tap notes devisedby merrill lynch. under this structure, an initial tranche of aminimum 50 mln dlrs has a fixed rate of interest and maturity.the borrower then issues additional notes in this category upto a pre-determined maximum.    those who defend the continuously offered method, such aswendy dietze, a salomon brothers inc vice president, point tothe flexibility they offer in interest rate and maturity.    furthermore, she believes this structure offers theeuropean investor greater confidence in market liquidity -- amajor concern for these buyers.    merrill lynch europe ltds kevin regan defends themedium-tranche tap notes concept saying it offers comparableliquidity. but he also said that this structure may not be theright option for all borrowers.    peter mortimer, a partner in the law firm milbank, tweed,hadley and mccloy, noted that legal requirements could welldetermine which structure is chosen.    he noted that the tap system allows a more clearly defined""lock-up"" period as each tranche has a specific maturity. in thecase of notes issued by u.s. borrowers, the ""lock-up"" period isthe 90 days after the completion of a series during which timea security cannot be sold back to the u.s. or to u.s.investors.    however, he said that the securities and exchangecommission is reviewing its current regulations on theownership of foreign securities by u.s. citizens and that somesoftening in the rules could come in the not too distantfuture.    for their part borrowers say they feel a bit like guineapigs.    petter skouen, executive vice president of the nordicinvestment bank (nib), noted that a few weeks ago nib wouldhave said it was disappointed with its euro-mtn program, butthat the success of a recent issue changed their minds.    he conceded that in retrospect it would have been wiser toestablish separate programs for the euromarket and the u.s.domestic market, rather than try to extend the u.s. issueglobally. under nibs 200 mln dlr program, 100 mln has beensold in the u.s. and 25 mln in europe. reuter"

""it would slow growth in germany and japan which wouldadversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it woulddrive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not(into) recession, into slower growth,"" he said.    asked if higher u.s. interest rates would stabilize thedollar, balladur said: ""when a currency is maintainedartificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it isnot healthy.""    and resorting to higher interest rates could lead torecession, he said.    acknowledging the dollars latest slide was now a fact oflife, balladur said, ""there may be adjustments of course in oneor other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.""    but federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said hemight rein in credit if the dollars slide deepens.    u.s. monetary sources also said washington wanted itunderstood by markets the sevens commitments were genuine.    ""the united states and the six major industrial countriesare fully committed to implementing our undertakings in theseagreements,"" baker told the meetings.    darman said baker had been misinterpreted by markets whichwrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a furtherdecline in the dollar. baker, darman said, was committed tostabilizing currencies at current levels.    last weeks statement from the seven reaffirmed a february22 agreement in paris in which the reagan administration agreedto reach a budget deficit compromise with congress and to fightprotectionism.    west germany and japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulatedomestic demand and lead a global upturn.    ministers believed the paris pact was bolstered by japanspromise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.    the sources said they believed baker saw it as a majoraction. but the seven seem to accept their commitment to stablecurrencies applied to todays exchange rates and not those atthe time of the paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.    the paris accord said, ""currencies (are) within rangesbroadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, giventhe policy commitments summarized in this statement.""    now they accept the dollars lower level, especiallyagainst the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistentwith the agreement. ""the ministers and governors reaffirmed theview that around current levels their currencies are withinranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,"" last weeksstatement read.    monetary sources said policymakers understood markets werefocusing on instability created by the gap between the u.s.trade deficit and the surpluses of west germany and japanrather than prospective policy changes. european monetarysources said bonn was still unconvinced that washington meantbusiness with its commitment to cut the budget deficit. reuter"

""i would think that the debtholders would want to entertainany and all offers (for dome),"" gobert said.    dome spokesman david annesley said in new york thattranscanadas announcement could be seen as an attempt to fixthe bidding price for dome and an effort to preclude otherpossible buyers from making an offer.

""the economy has developed a certain self-confidence that isnow less dependent on the political situation,"" said fritzhaser, economics professor at universidade livre, lisbon.    ""the market doesnt see this as a real crisis yet,"" economistjorge braga de macedo told reuters.    businessmen have identified political instability over thelast 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lastingeconomic progress.    the psd administration was the 16th formed since the 1974revolution.    portugals developing stock markets, however, remainbuoyant. brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surgein economic confidence under the psd rule was still largelyunderpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.    investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a bank ofportugal forecast, released on the day the psd government fell,predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growthwould remain at similar levels this year.    but analysts said the crisis interrupted current policiesand could slow economic development.    soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the endof the month, can either call early elections or form a newgovernment from parties in the existing left wing-dominatedparliament.    many businessmen said they strongly favoured quickelections as the best solution. ""there is a good chance that amajority government could result from early elections,""confederation of portuguese industry (cip) president pedroferraz da costa said.    he said they were optimistic this could mean thecontinuation in the near future of liberalisation policiesintroduced over the last year.    the left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, butthe psd said it wants an early election in which opinion pollssay they could win an overall majority.    a psd majority would also open the way for morewide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws andpossible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.    cavaco silva has accused the left-wing opposition partiesof blocking key economic reforms.    the left-wingers said portugals positive economic resultswere more the product of favourable international conditionssuch as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of psdpolicies. reuter"

""but it has often turned out in the past that the priceclimate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank intoa restrictive policy,"" they said.    the economic costs of a preventive stability policy areless than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.    the four institutes disputed the view that monetaryexpansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domesticinvestors switch liquidity into longer term capital marketinvestments following lower interest rates.    ""such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion ofcentral bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to asmaller expansion of money supply,"" they said.    a return to growth and stability did not requirespectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly withopen market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoidan interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.    the diw institute said monetary policy should not befocused simply on growth of production potential. because ofuncertainty about exchange rate developments and economicweakness other factors should be taken into account.    monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cutsand avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluationspeculation. recent strong monetary expansion was not a threatin itself to price stability.    the 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growthreflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and thefalling mark. reuter"

""a prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,""said robert brusca of nikko securities co international inc.    brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct isjustified because the spread between banks cost of funds andthe prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of apercentage point.    he said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentagepoints since last october until it fell below one point andtriggered the april prime rate rise at most banks.    ""we could easily have another prime rate increase as soonas this week,"" said david jones of aubrey g. lanston and co.    ""weve got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in thenear future,"" said allan leslie of discount corp.    ""based on the spread between the prime rate and fundingcosts, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,""said harold nathan, economist at wells fargo bank.    however, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the primebecause that would dampen already fairly weak business loandemand and because some are not sure the fed will maintainrecent upward pressure on money market interest rates.    nathan believes the fed has let market pressures liftshort-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. hesaid ""if there is widespread belief money market rates willstay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.""    fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep adollar drop could help rekindle u.s. inflation. as the dollarfell to a 40-year low against the yen friday, currency traderssaid the fed and other central banks supported the dollar.    in addition to buying dollars outright, another way tostabilize the u.s. currency would be for the fed to push u.s.interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.    based particularly on the feds reserve management actionson friday and today, nathan of wells fargo said ""it has becomeclear that the fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressurein the market. it is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.""    bank funding costs and other short and long-term interestrates rose sharply friday and today on heightened speculationthat the fed is gently firming monetary policy.    that was because the fed supplied far fewer reserves in themarket than most economists had expected.    on friday, the fed added reserves indirectly and in smallamounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreementswith the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one anotherhigh at 6-5/16 pct. with funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pcttoday, the fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlrround of customer repurchase agreements.    ""the feds actions on friday and today show that it isoffering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,""said jones of lanston.

""most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as theycould,"" elton said. but following mondays supreme courtruling, texacos suppliers began demanding cash and haltingsupplies.    ""it wasnt until last wednesday that it turned into anavalanche,"" he said. ""supplies were cut to the point where wecould not run the system at anywhere near capacity.""    he said less than half of texacos oil supplies had been injeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortagesby mid-may. now the situation appears much less severe, eltonsaid.    it said that sonatrach, the algerian national oil company,canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,occidental petroleum co <oxy> demanded cash for crude, andatlantic richfield co <arc> asked for special safeguards.    the company also said british petroleum co plc <bp> lastweek refused to accept an order for fuel oil. but yates todaysaid, ""a big u.k. company has in fact said they would go onsupplying. they had cancelled last week.""    he declined to identify the company.    <petroleos de venezuela s.a.>, the venezuelan state oilcompany that supplies a large portion of texacos oil, alsohalted shipments two weeks ago, yates said.    but he added that texaco expected to meet with thevenezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that keysupply line. talks were also expected to take place with thealgerians, he added.    bankruptcy specialists said it was likely texacos chapter11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit linesand oil supplies that are key to the companys business.    ""it will be business as usual for texaco,"" said martinklein, a bankruptcy attorney at the new york law firm dreyerand traub.    ""creditors are a nervous bunch of people,"" he said. ""butwhen the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation andwill likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company.""    but other officials at texaco were not immediatelyavailable to say whether discussions were being held with itsbanks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished. reuter"

[],16864,test,yes,argentina sees quick completion of debt deal,"argentinas controversial newfinancing package should be completed quickly thanks to a widerange of innovative options in the deal, said jorge gonzalez,undersecretary for external debt in the economics ministry.    the deal offers banks a lucrative fee if they sign earlyand an ""exit bond"" provision allowing banks to sell as much asfive mln dlrs of their existing loans. gonzalez also disclosedthat banks will have the choice of lending up to one mln dlrsin the form of a bearer bond. ""we expect to complete thepackage very quickly,"" he said in a telephone interview.    by providing their share of the 1.55 billion dlrs in newmoney being raised for argentina via an easily tradable bearerbond instead of a participation in the syndicated loan, smallerbanks could avoid time-consuming legal paperwork.    the bonds, currently dubbed ""alternative participationinstruments,"" would carry the same terms as the syndicated loan- a 12-year term, five years grace and an interest rate marginof 7/8 pct over eurodollar rates, gonzalez said.    the idea of the ""exit bond"" is that a creditor bank mayexchange up to five mln dlrs of existing debt for a new,tradeable bond that bears below-market interest rates.    in return for accepting a lower yield, the amount of debtconverted will be subtracted from the banks exposure forpurposes of calculating its contribution to future new loans.    gonzalez said it was difficult to say how many banks wouldtake up the ""exit bonds"" because no such instrument has beenoffered before.    on paper, however, argentinas lending syndicate couldshrink dramatically because over 100 of the countrys 350creditors have exposure of less than five mln dlrs.    details of the ""exit bonds"" are still being finalized,gonzalez added.    argentina has pressed hard for a streamlining of thelending process because it has bitter memories of its lastpackage, which was agreed with the citibank-led steeringcommittee in december 1984 but not signed until august 1985.    gonzalez praised the committee for its cooperation in thelatest negotiations and said the resulting deal, which wasannounced by the banks on wednesday, should put argentina onthe road to meeting its economic goals.    ""we believe this is a package that will help argentine tocontinue on the track it has elected to follow - stable growthand equilibrium in the external accounts,"" he said.    asked what role the reagan administration had played in thefinal stages of the talks, gonzalez said it had lent ""practicalsupport.""    he did not elaborate, but bankers said the u.s. had pressedfor an agreement after economics minister juan sourrouillethreatened at last weeks spring meeting in washington of theinternational monetary fund to break off talks unless banksstopped blocking a deal.    the specter of argentina emulating brazil and suspendinginterest payments haunted policymakers and bankers alike, whohave long feared the emergence of a debtors cartel.    ""that was a feeling among people on the committee,"" onebanker said.    as a result bankers agreed to give argentina the sameinterest rate margin as mexico, 13/16 pct, on the reschedulingof 30 billion dlrs of debt, even though they knew this wouldraise the ire of the philippines and venezuela, which paid 7/8pct on recent rescheduling packages.    asked about the angry reaction of the manila government,which promptly said wednesday that it would demand a spread of13/16 pct, gonzalez said this was a matter between thephilippines and the banks. reuter"

""you can make the case that the deal is not 13/16 pct,"" onebanker said. another, referring to the philippine debtnegotiators, said ""the only reason theyd have to come back tonew york is political, not economic.""    ongpin has said as much himself, estimating that an extra1/16 percentage point would cost just 5.1 mln dlrs a year.    but the source close to the philippines said ongpins angergoes beyond the dollars. he said the minister feels personallybetrayed by bankers who insisted mexicos 13/16 pct was arock-bottom spread that could not be duplicated. top u.s.treasury and federal reserve officials had said the same.    the source said ongpin is unlikely to come to the u.s. topress his case and was expecting the philippines bank advisorycommittee, headed by manufacturers hanover trust co, tonegotiate the spread reduction by telex.    ongpin has not said the philippines will unilaterally startpaying interest at the lower rate but has made it clear to thecommittee in a telex that he is not prepared to pay more thanmexico and argentina, the source said.    ""the philippines really means business on this. i dontthink theres much room for compromise,"" he said.    manufacturers hanover declined to comment on the issue.    the philippines last month won an agreement to reschedule10.3 billion dlrs of debt over 17 years at an interest rate of7/8 pct, whereas some 30 billion dlrs in old argentine debtwill be stretched out over 19 years with a spread of 13/16 pct.    bankers said they were forced to break their word becausepolitical circumstances had changed in the past few weeks.    in particular, they said it had become clear that argentinawas serious about its threat to suspend interest paymentsunless it got a good deal. fearing that an argentine moratoriumwould stiffen the resolve of its neighbour brazil, which hasalready suspended payments, the banks, at the urging of thereagan administration, bowed to argentinas demands.    some u.s. bankers argued that, regardless of politics, therich menu of options in the argentine package makes itattractive enough to justify a 13/16 pct rescheduling rate.    ""when they (the philippines) see the whole package, theymay realize that this is not a mexican deal,"" one banker saidof the argentine agreement.    the argentine pact contains several features that were notin the mexican accord such as ""exit bonds,"" an option toprovide new money via bearer bonds, a trade facility, onlendingprovisions and a debt-equity conversion scheme.    moreover, argentina is requesting only 1.95 billion dlrs innew loans, compared with mexicos 7.7 billion, and is paying7/8 pct for most of the money instead of the 13/16 pct chargedto mexico.    this line of argument cuts no ice with the filipinos, whonote drily that they asked for no new money at all.    ""the banks reacted on the level of politics to argentinaand try to justify it in terms of economics, and now theyregoing to have problems with both the philippines andvenezuela,"" said the source close to the manila government.    because of the easter holidays bankers have not yet got anofficial reaction from venezuela, which is also paying 7/8 pcton its 20.2 billion dlr rescheduling. but they acknowledgedthat caracas, which was also told that the mexico spread wasinviolate, is quite likely to demand a lower spread.    bankers were more sanguine in the case of chile.    because it is under fire for its human-rights record, thegovernment of general augusto pinochet is unlikely to attractattention to itself by seeking to renegotiate its recent debtpackage, which carries interest of one pct, bankers said.    they hope that, once tempers cool, the philippines willalso accept that reopening an agreement that took 4-1/2 toughmonths to negotiate will be more trouble than it is worth. reuter"

['money-supply'],17036,test,yes,fed data provide new evidence of tighter policy,"u.s. banking data released today aretoo distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetarypolicy, but they do support the markets assumption that thefederal reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,economists said.    ""its clear that the fed has firmed somewhat. discountwindow borrowings, net free reserves, the fed funds rateaverage and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistentwith a modest tightening,"" said dana johnson of first chicagocorp.    johnson, and several other economists, now estimate thatthe fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.    discount window borrowings in the week to wednesday were935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-weekstatement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week ofdecember 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.    moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billiondlrs from the fed on wednesday - the highest daily total thisyear - even though unexpectedly low treasury balances at thefed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more inreserves than the fed had anticipated.    however, economists said it is almost certain that the fedis aiming for much lower discount window borrowings thanwitnessed this week. they pointed to two factors that may haveforced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.    first, economists now expect m-1 money supply for the weekended april 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of theproceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions topay annual income taxes.    as banks checking-account liabilities rise, so do thereserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the fed.    required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billiondlrs a day in the two weeks ended wednesday, but economistssaid the fed may not have believed in the magnitude of theprojected m-1 surge until late in the week and so started toadd reserves too late.    second, an apparent shortage of treasury bills apparentlyleft wall street dealers with too little collateral with whichto enagage in repurchase agreements with the fed, economistssaid. thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of reposoutstanding on wednesday night, the fed may have wanted to addeven more reserves but was prevented from doing so.    ""its not at all inconceivable that the fed didnt add asmuch as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,""said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch economics inc.    mccarthy estimated that the fed is now targettingdiscount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,equivalent to a fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.    after citing the reasons why the fed probably has nottightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,economists said the fact that the fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of thestatement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.    jeffrey leeds of chemical bank had not been convinced thatthe fed was tightening policy. but after reviewing todaysfigures, he said, ""its fair to say that the fed may be movingtoward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.""    leeds expects fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8pct and said the fed is unlikely to raise the discount rateunless the dollars fall gathers pace.    johnson at first chicago agreed, citing politicalopposition in washington to a dollar-defense package at a timewhen congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key toreducing the u.s. trade surplus with japan. reuter"

(see ecra for spotlight headlines)    ""we are looking at trade, interest rates and financialflows.....in order to put forward a basis for some permanentsolutions,"" mexicos public credit director angel gurria said.    recent developments have led to moves for a summit of latinamerican presidents and debate on new solutions.    ideas include schemes to link debt payments to trade, andproposals for stable interest rates. the latter was proposed ina letter this week from cartagena to g-7 leaders who are due toattend a summit in venice this month.    another idea is to include debt under gatt negotiations,but cartegena ministers have yet to endorse any proposals.    speaking earlier in new york, uruguays foreign ministerand cartagena group chairman enrique iglesias said citicorpsdecision could discourage new lending. but it might helpcartagenas bid to have old and new debt treated separately.    the cartagena group, which has not met at ministerial levelfor over a year, wants to repay debt contracted before the debtcrisis at the low interest rates prevailing in the 1970s. itwould pay new loans at current market rates.    ""many countries fear that what they have gained in months ofarduous debt negotiations they can lose at a stroke with a onepoint rise in interest rates,"" one official here said.    ""the new increase in interest rates has come precisely whenwe thought they had still not come down enough,"" iglesias said.    latin american officials are also concerned that varyinginterest spreads granted to different debtor nations couldgenerate discord, as with the philippines recent protest atbeing given less favourable terms than argentina.    there has been speculation venezuela would demand a cut inits 7/8 pct spread, but public finances director jorge marcanosaid here there were no plans to renegotiate terms.    this weeks meeting came after three latin americanpresidents meeting in montevideo called for stable interestrates on the regions 380 billion dlr foreign debt. it wascalled to review developments since the last ministerialmeeting in february 1986 and to think up new ideas.    since the last ministerial meeting there have been someadvances, such as mexicos growth-oriented 77 billion dlr loanand refinancing package agreed last september. but there havealso been setbacks, like brazils payments moratorium.    the loans expected in the baker plan have not materializedand debtors have been forced to browbeat reluctant banks.    ""we have clearly stretched the restructuring process to itslimits and and the question is now where do we go from here?"" asenior mexican foreign ministry official said.    existing debt strategy has been based on nursing debtoreconomies back to a position where they can again service theirdebts and qualify for new loans.    but after five years of economic adjustment, latin americandebtors are currently unable to raise voluntary credits, withthe exception of colombia. only venezuela is paying backprincipal. most countries have no prospect of paying theirdebts in the foreseeable future.    citicorp has made clear its decision to move three billiondlrs to reserves does not mean it is writing-off the loans.    latin american officials here said citicorps move wouldprobably boost trading of discounted third world debt in thesecondary market, implicitly downvaluing the amount owed. butthey said it might make new lending even more remote.    discounted debt can be bought by foreign investors throughdebt-equity schemes that generate new resources for debtoreconomies. chile and mexico are currently front-runners in thisfield, but most latin american officials see these schemes aslimited and no panacea for the overall problem.    most latin officials set greater store on building upexport income than on debt-equity schemes.    exports hit 97.7 billion dlrs in 1984, cutting the regionsdebt service ratio to 36 pct, but they fell to 78.3 billionlast year. so, even though interest rates had dropped the ratiohardly changed.    the cartagena group has called for the debt-trade link tobe recognized before, but has not made detailed proposals.    officials said initiatives discussed here would besubmitted to foreign and finance ministers of the 11 nations,before imf and world bank annual meetings later this year. reuter"
['trade'],17452,test,yes,u.s. study says tariffs and quotas could backfire,"the use of tariffs and quotas toreduce the flow of foreign goods into the united states will dolittle to cut the nations swelling trade deficit, a governmentstudy said.    in fact, the federal trade commission (ftc) report said,such protectionist policies could make u.s. products lesscompetitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost ofimported products that are re-exported in different forms.    ""such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather thanhelp, the productive capabilities of the u.s. economy,"" it said.    the 218-page report, written by ftc economists john hilkeand philip nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, whichclimbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shiftingcurrency exchange rates and growing u.s consumer demand.    other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such asforeign trade practices, deteriorating u.s. industrialcompetitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictionson mergers, added little to the problem, it said.    ""although each industrys competitiveness affects the levelof imports and exports in that industry, in general we findthat there have been no significant industry-specific changesaffecting competitiveness that would explain the increase inthe overall trade deficit,"" the study said.    ""to the extent any government action is needed to deal withthe trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-widephenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,""the ftc study said.    supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shiftswere the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the reportsaid it found that nearly all u.s. industries lost somedomestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.    it also said it found a ""fairly direct relationship"" betweenthe increased trade deficit and the influence of shiftingcurrency exchange rates, u.s. economic growth and domesticdemand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreignconsumer demand.    the study examined seven factors which have been commonlyblamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies andtrade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack ofinvestment in u.s. industry, declining research and developmentin u.s. industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oilprices rises of the 1970s and u.s. antitrust regulations.    in each case, the study found little or no evidence thatthe factor had any impact on the trade deficit. reuter"

""we have no intention of revising the terms of the accord,""he said.

""venezuela has restructured its debt so that most of it isbeing repaid at 7/8 pct, which i think is better than the othercountries,"" he said. the rescheduling accord covers some 90 pctof venezuelas commercial bank debt, which accounts for morethan 90 pct of the total public sector external debt.    venezuela has almost no debt outstanding to multilateralagencies.    marcano said attempting to revise the rescheduling accord asecond time would probably hurt venezuelas bid to restore itcredit rating and raise new loans.    he said venezuela now obtains trade credit lines without agovernment guarantee, something that argentina and others arejust starting to try to negotiate in their restructuringpackages.    venezuela is currently seeking loans in japan and westgermany to finance steel and aluminium expansion.    according to finance minister manuel azpurua, a 100 mlnmark credit has been lined up for the venalum aluminium plant.    marcano said no mandate has yet been given for a planned100 mln dlr bond issue, although he confirmed that talks werecontinuing with morgan guaranty and other banks.    banking sources said one option was to privately place thebonds through the caracas-based banco de venezuela, which wouldunderwrite the issue, but marcano said no decision has yet beenmade. reuter"

""i intend to visit brussels and talk to whoever is puttingup this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countrieslike the philippines,"" romero said in an interview.    he said he did not know how much support the levy hadwithin the ec but he said he believed those originally opposedto the tax were under pressure to change their position.    romero said a group of ec members led by west germany, thenetherlands, denmark and norway were opposed to the tax. butthere was a danger some of them would be persuaded to changesides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.    romero said another threat to exports lay in an ec warningthat copra meal cake used in livestock feeds containeddangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.    he said the ec standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin permillion parts of meal, which ec countries had been asked toapply by october 1988, was too rigid. he said philippine copracake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.    aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when itis not properly dried or ground.    romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal inlondon that the philippines was doing its best to meet ecstandards. it was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,but this was likely to take several years of research.    copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of totalcoconut exports in 1986. the meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.    romero said he would also visit oxford universitysdepartment of agricultural economics to discuss ways ofavoiding the copra process altogether.

""we can process fresh coconut without dryingthe meat in the sun. through the wet process we can processcoconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go tothe chemical root.""    he said there was a tendency for agricultural countries tobecome more protectionist and he expected export prices ofcoconut products to drop.

""to add to that the u.s. soybean association is spendingbillions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil bysaying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,""he said.    romero said he expected coconut product export prices tostay up for the rest of the year. they would probably touch ahigh of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.    romero said the philippines was at the end of a five-yearcoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fallafter two successive years of good harvests.    he said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, toadd to the production fall, drought had affected output.    ""traders are stocking up and when they have overbought theprices will start declining again. the only sure way to keepprices stable is by processing, adding more value,"" he said.    coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop byplanting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.

""it will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreementnegotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,""the abn economist said.    he said dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct injanuary, could also contribute to some inflation.    at amro bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run totwo pct next year. the bank expects dutch capital market rates,currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in thesecond half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.    analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buyingspree on the bond market which would bring yields down,probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall belowfive pct.    currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct inthe money market. reuter"

"['interest', 'gnp']",17883,test,yes,no reason to cut rates - bundesbank's schlesinger,"bundesbank vice president helmutschlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.    with money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down inmay and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,schlesinger told reuters that he was not convinced that afurther cut in interest rates was needed.    the economy is picking up, after contracting by aseasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter fromthe fourth, he added. ""we may have an increase in gnp startingin the second quarter,"" he said in an interview.    concerned by the first quarter downturn, the u.s. has beenpressing west germany to pump up its economy and boost itsimports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.    schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter wasmainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in1986. year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.    he estimated that economic growth for the year as a wholewould probably be between one and two pct.   ""it is not a question of monetary conditions if domesticdemand does not grow strongly,"" he said, noting that interestrates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.    schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank moneystock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year paceof 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the bundesbanks three to sixpct target.    he said the target could still be achieved but much willdepend on the direction of long-term capital flows. heavyinflows, particularly in january around the time of the emsrevaluation, boosted domestic money supply.    ""there is still a certain hope that the net inflow offoreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bitreversed,"" schlesinger said.    a major reason for the inflows was the markets convictionthat the mark was headed higher. ""as we can see from the market,expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark havediminished,"" schlesinger said.    the recent widening of interest rate differentials, thefact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short periodand an improvement in real trade balances have all combinedtowards stabilizing the dollar, he said.    asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollarrise, as the u.s. did in march when the dollar rose above 1.87marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.    at midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.    ""central banks are always in contact about thesefluctuations but i cannot give any answer how they would react,""schelsinger said.    ""one has to look at how it (the market) is moving,"" he said,adding, ""it is not only our own case, it is also the americancase.""    he said that the west german export industry has been hithard by the dollars sharp fall and would probably like to seesome correction now. ""but it wouldnt be good to have short-termfluctuations,"" he said. ""let us wait and see.""    ""it is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a veryshort period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level(of rates) as such,"" schlesinger said.    the sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices ofsuch key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on westgerman inflation down year.    although there have recently been signs of inflationpicking up, he said that this was due to changes in keycommodity prices. the underlying inflation rate this year wouldbe unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.    schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growthwas longer term, in that the economy was building up thepotential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.    the above-target growth of money supply over the past 16months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness oftargets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at themid-year meeting of the bundesbanks council, schlesigner said.    but he added: ""i dont see any great pressure to go awayfrom it."" reuter"

""i dont see anything on the horizon that should cut it(growth) short,"" fernandez said.     neda said gnp had grown 3.56 pct and gdp 3.25 pct in thefourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. last years gnpgrowth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.    ""certainly i do not see any shortage in external resourcesand if gnp growth continues at this level i would assume thatdomestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated andwould not be a stumbling block,"" fernandez said.    ""i think even before the figures came out, simply looking atkey indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,showed that the economy was on a different track from lastyear,"" he said.    fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in thefirst and second quarters because of the dry weather, and itcould drop off in the third quarter.    he said the most significant sign of recovery lay in themanufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.    ""that is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,"" he said.    he said the government had met all monetary targets set forthe first quarter in consultation with the internationalmonetary fund (imf). it expected to draw down the fourthtranche from its 198 mln sdr stand-by arrangement soon.    the philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling58 mln sdrs from the arrangement expiring on april 23, 1988.fernandez said an imf mission would visit here in july oraugust to review performance in the january-june period.    he said imf repayments were projected to total 1.56 billiondlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.repayments were inevitable and many countries would find theirnet repayments to the imf rising in the next few years.    ""it means that since there will be a net drain on oda(official development assistance) accounts the commercialbanking system will be requested to hold the line,"" he said.    it is an internal constraint that exists because the imfdebt cannot be rescheduled, fernandez said.    the philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28billion dlr foreign commercial debt in march.    fernandez said central bank bills, introduced in march 1984to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos inapril 1986. but their unwinding on maturity dates, started inoctober last year, had almost been completed.    he said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding leveltouched 95.44 billion pesos on may 20, were going well.""treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,"" he said.    commenting on the countrys foreign debt fernandez said, ""ithink the philippine debt stock looms large because our ownreceipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leapforward as might have been suitable.""    the foreign debt is projected by the central bank to reach29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.    neda said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the firstquarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.    fernandez said the government had targeted gnp growth ofbetween six and 6.5 pct this year. he cautioned that whilegrowth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.    fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by someeconomists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to thedollar, ought to be devalued to make the countrys exports morecompetitive.    ""by being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the pesohas already substantially devalued against all of the countrystrading partners,"" he said.    on the proposed omnibus investment code, he said he wasopposed to a clause which would allow the unrestrictedrepatriation abroad of investments made during the first twoyears after the imposition of the code.    the imposition of the code, scheduled for last january, hasbeen delayed by objections from some business groups.

['money-fx'],17915,test,yes,poehl looks set for eight more years at bundesbank,"for currency dealers karl otto poehl isthe scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who hasplayed a key role in shaping the worlds financial destiny forthe last seven years, and for germans he is the guardian of themark.    president of the powerful and independent west germancentral bank, the bundesbank, poehl is likely to have hiscontract renewed for another eight years when it expires at theend of this year, government officials say.    (index of economic spotlights, see page ecra)    but no official announcement has yet been made, raisingeyebrows in west germanys business community.    the ebullient poehl spent seven years in bonn in topministerial posts under the social democrats, now inopposition, before he moved to the bundesbank.    there has been speculation that chancellor helmut kohlwould try to replace poehl with a man closer to his ownchristian democrats. but officials noted that poehl has workedclosely and successfully with finance minister gerhardstoltenberg since kohls government took office in 1982.    poehl, the most senior central banker apart from paulvolcker of the united states, enjoys a strong internationalreputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.    given these circumstances, kohl will probably overlookpoehls past as an adviser to former social democrat chancellorwilly brandt, and top aide to helmut schmidt when he wasfinance minister, bankers said. it was schmidt who, aschancellor, appointed poehl to his present job in 1980.    in recent months, with the marks strong rise against thedollar, poehl has made exchange rates the central concern ofthe bundesbanks council, a highly conservative institutionwhich has doggedly pursued monetary policies to preventinflation catching hold. older germans can remember two boutsof galloping inflation this century.    but with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, andinflation negligible so far this year, poehl thinks it is safeto relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on thedangers to the german economy of a bloated exchange rate.    ""i am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise thedollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for thebundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the markwould endanger the economy in west germany,"" he told businessjournalists in frankfurt recently.    ute geipel, head of research at citibank ag, says thatpoehls reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.    ""poehls policy has always been a policy which does notfocus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the externaleconomy,"" she said.    an economist at a german bank, who declined to beidentified, said ""if poehl is confirmed in his post, it willcertainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not sorigidly oriented towards money supply.""    one of poehls great struggles recently has been topersuade the united states to stop ""talking down"" the dollar. forpoehl, the significance of the february louvre accord was thatthe united states agreed to join efforts to stabilisecurrencies.    the louvre accord was greeted with scepticism by currencydealers who said they would soon put it to the test. but infact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.    ""this is because the markets know - or perhaps because theydont know - what the central banks can do,"" poehl says ofintervention in currency markets which can quickly turn ratesround, making a speculators position worthless.    poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalistin the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.    a relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes overa glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.    he is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football andplay golf.    poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitutefor correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.    ""but you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amountif you strike at the right moment,"" he said. bundesbank dealersare very professional and skilled. ""theyve burnt the fingers ofmany people,"" he said. and unlike the speculators, poehl notes,the bundesbank dealers usually make a profit. reuter"

""the world bank by its established policies cannot use itsresources to finance the transfer of assets from one group toanother. our mandate is to finance investment-relatedactivities,"" rolando arrivillaga, the banks residentrepresentative in the philippines, told reuters in aninterview.    arrivillaga said he wanted to clarify part of a report by aworld bank mission that came in march to review the land reformprogram and which said the bank would not be able to financecompensation payments for the transfer of land.    he said the philippine government had never asked the bankto finance land transfers, and the banks position should notbe taken to mean that it ruled out any lending for the program.    ""clearly in the case of land reform the question of landtransfer by definition is transferring assets from the landedto the landless,"" arrivillaga said.

""i wouldnt be surprised if other multilateral institutionsare faced with similar constraints,"" he said.    president corazon aquinos spokesman said last week thatshe was committed to launching the program, which limits landholdings to seven hectares, by using her sweeping powers ofrule by decree before a new congress convenes in july.    presidential spokesman teodoro benigno said the land reformprogram, estimated to cost about 44 billion pesos, would beimplemented in four phases and benefit 2.64 mln farmers.    benigno said the first two phases would complete thetransfer of rice and corn lands and abandoned farmland as wellas the transfer of land sequestered, expropriated or foreclosedby the government and would cover 1.15 mln hectares.    but aquino would not decree the redistribution of largesugar, banana and coconut plantations, leaving it to thecongress to work out the details, benigno said.    arrivillaga said bilateral aid donors, who form part of aconsultative group led by the world bank, might be prepared tofinance the land transfers.    ""i dont think there are fast and easy rules as to howinternational sources of finance would behave in a situationlike this, because land reform by its very nature requires richfinancing to be able to carry out the reform in a way equitableto both the landowner and the beneficiary,"" he said.    arrivillaga said the first priority for the governmentwould be to tap domestic sources of financing for the landtransfer, but external assistance could be brought in if therewere gaps.    ""in such a fundamental reform the test of the willingness ofthe government is how it confronts the domestic resourcerequirement,"" arrivillaga said. ""multilateral agencies by theirvery nature are lenders of last resort. it means they have tobe convinced that the government prioritises the program.""    he said the world bank had financed developmental costsunder an earlier land reform program launched by formerpresident ferdinand marcos in 1972, and such aid had beenchannelled through the land bank of the philippines (lbp).    the lbp is the main implementing agency under aquinosprogram.    ""if asked to do so again and the program is designed toimprove the standard of living of the poor then we wouldcertainly be prepared to consider (lending),"" arrivillaga said.    he said the tendency in such programs was to exaggerate thecosts by presenting ten-year perspectives in a one-yearcontext.    arrivillaga said the government could solve most of itsfinancing problems by devising effective instruments tocompensate landowners.    finance secretary jaime ongpin has said landowners arelikely to be paid 10 pct in cash and the rest in 10-year bondswith 10 pct of their face value redeemable each year.    arrivillaga said any instruments used to compensatelandowners had to be freely tradable at near face value andadded: ""the challenge is to devise a system of deferred paymentsthat is as good as cash.""    he said the international financing community was watchingthe philippine experiment with great interest.

""we have been intervening to a very much greater extent thanwe have done hitherto,"" chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawsonsaid at a news conference today, commenting on the news of therecord reserves rise.    he put the u.k. intervention in the context of the louvreaccord between leading industrial nations to stabilise thedollar, partly through direct intervention on foreignexchanges. ""we have been playing a very full part ourselves,"" hesaid.    but market analysts see the recent upward pressure onsterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp downits rise, more in the light of local factors.    steven bell, chief economist at morgan grenfell securities,said that corporate money has been flowing back into britainamid hopes of another conservative government, after fears lastautumn of a labour election victory sent it flooding out.    u.k. portfolio investment is also returning, while foreignbuyers see u.k. growth propects and high bond yields asattractive. they will be strong buyers of u.k. assets, notablyequities, once the election is out of the way, bell said.    analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lowerinterest rates, as the government is expected to try to reversethe loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.    today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reservesnews, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket ofcurrencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 gmt to 73.0pct at 1100 gmt, half an hour after the figures were released.    ""the market doesnt want to do anything because of theelection,"" commented an economist at a big u.s. investment bank.    several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts ofa rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs hadoverestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely tohave been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on theforward market.    the market also seemed to have overestimated the amount ofsterling the bank of england bought at the end of may to smooththe pounds sudden downturn, while some of the interventionreported in may probably occurred in april, they said.    the key three months interbank money market rates easedabout 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrendin u.k. interest rates will be revived following the reservesnews, analysts said.    government bond prices initially firmed, but the market wasmuted as traders worried about the funding implications ofanother huge rise in reserves, they added.    morgan grenfells bell forecast a half point base rate cutfrom the current nine pct level soon after the election, solong as poll projections of another conservative victory proveaccurate, with another half point later.    justin silverton, equity economist at credit suissebuckmaster and moore, said a full point reduction might bepossible. ""sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts infuture, rather than this active intervention,"" he predicted.    kevin boakes of greenwell montagu gilt-edged cautionedagainst over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cutlooked likely.    a cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.

""fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, butsimply raising government spending and increasing the budgetdeficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,"" said rob lee,chief economist at south african mutual life assurance co.    south africa this year is targeting inflation-adjustedgrowth in gdp of three pct against an increase last year ofless than one pct.    growth in gdp over the past decade has averaged about 1.5pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled toover 30 pct.    economists estimate that the governments spending targetwill rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted ataround 40 billion rand. this would leave a budget deficitbefore borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct ofgdp.    the government, having consistently overshot its ownspending targets for more than a decade, also faces acredibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in thebudget, analysts said.    ""the budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,""said standard bank ltd in a budget preview.    many analysts in the private sector are now paying lessattention to the figures presented in the budget and are usingtheir own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for themoney and capital markets.    south african mutuals lee believes government spendingwill again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5pct of gdp, compared with a three pct limit suggested by theimf.    ""the imf limit is obviously going to be abandoned,"" predictedone analyst, noting that south africa has moved steadily awayfrom austerity measures recommended by the imf over the pasttwo years.    the policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in thepolitical situation and the onset of an economic crisistriggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll overloans to the country in september 1985.    against a background of western economic sanctions, fallingper capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,government officials say economic growth is the primeobjective.    but private-sector economists caution that the governmentsability to promote growth by boosting state spending isconstrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on thecurrent account of the countrys balance of payments.    most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on thenations estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of anarrangement reached earlier this year with major internationalcreditor banks.    within these constraints, economists believe du plessis haslittle room to manoeuvre.    analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries andbudgeted spending increases for the state-owned post office andsouth african transport services suggest that major taxconcessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.    du plessis earlier this year announced small concessionsfor taxpayers in a mini-budget before the may 6 whites-onlyelection. the poll delayed presentation of the national budget.    ""this will not be a very exciting budget,"" commented harryschwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal progressivefederal party.

[],17976,test,yes,new problems for world bank in debt strategy,"the world bank, in the throes of apainful reorganization, faces new strains because of actions bycitibank and others to set aside new latin debt reserves,financial analysts and monetary sources said.    the monetary sources said the reorganization has causedsome bad feelings and charges that promotions and otherpersonnel actions have been based on personality rather thanability. it also had some effect in undermining the banks rolein the global debt strategy, the sources said.    at the center of the controversy is bank president barberconable, whose reorganization efforts are getting some critical review from many bank staff members and some member-countries including the united states.    ""i think if he were to do it again, he would do it verydifferently,"" said one source.    conable, a former congressman from new york appointed bypresident reagan to the senior most position at the bank nearlya year ago, has taken the view that the bank badly needed to bereorganized and perhaps made more streamlined.    in this he had the backing of many in the reaganadministration who viewed the bank as a bloated and inefficientbureaucracy that gave money to countries when other free-marketsources of assistance were available.    however, the bank had been singled out for a much greaterrole under the u.s. debt initiative proposed by treasurysecretary james baker.  that strategy, which called for some 20billion dlrs in new funding from the commerical banks and ninebillion dlrs in spending from the development banks, mostly theworld bank, came under profound doubt with the decision bycitibank and chase manhattan to set aside new reserves.    this move, heralded by some sources as a measure that givesall parties more time, frightened others, who see it as thebeginning of a tit for tat exercise that could lead to completeunraveling of the monetary system.    as envisioned by the latter, the next move would be forbrazil, which has delayed payments on its debts, to say it doesnot intend to pay interest for a very long period of time.    citibank and other banks could then decide to stopfinancing the countrys export credits, the funds countries useto support their daily activities, leading to an economicbreakdown.    ""within six weeks alot of countries could be out ofbusiness,"" said one source.    citibanks initial step last month was to set some threebillion dlrs in a general reserve for potential losses on loansto developing countries.  it was followed by a similar move bychase manhattan some days later.    in the best of all worlds, the kind of cooperation that wasdemonstrated between the international monetary fund (imf), themultilateral development banks, the wealthy countries andcommercial banks when the debt crisis surfaced in 1982, couldemerge again but no one is expecting that.    if anything, the negotiations have become much moreconfrontational with the debtor countries pressing for moreconcessions, arguing that they face growing politicalinstability if they are asked to do or pay more.    they are very critical of the imfs austerity measures andthere is sympathy for their view among the developmentcommunity.    ""when you hear code words like structural adjustment andtightening your belt.  what that means is that the poor peasentmaking 700 dlrs a year should drop it to 500 dlrs,"" says onesource.    he adds: ""and when your hear they should have market forcesat play, that means the level of public services should drop.""    it had been hoped that giving the world bank a greater rolein the debt strategy might defuse the growing resistance in thedebtor countries to measures that increased already prevalentpoverty even further.   the bank, which primarily assists countries in the buildingof roads, sewerage systems, education, and other so-calledinfrastructure, is viewed in the third world as benefactor.   the imf, however, which essentially forged the debt stategyfollowing the disclosure by mexico in 1982 that it was neardefault, is considered a stern taskmaster that has littlesympathy or even understanding of poverty.    but there are doubts about how well the baker initiativehas worked and about the world banks success at bringing aboutincreased growth in the third world under the u.s. prescriptionwhich indicated that countries might grow their way out oftheir difficulty. reuter"

""i see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,"" saidpaul oreffice, chairman of giant dow chemical co <dow>, adding,""theres no major plant capacity being added around the worldnow. the whole game is bringing out new products and improvingthe old ones.""    analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers,automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot ofpaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.    u.s. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hikeproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said john dosher,managing director of pace consultants inc of houston. demandfor some products such as styrene could push profit margins upby as much as 300 pct, he said.    oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers inhouston, said dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earnedlast year and predicted it would have the best year in itshistory.    in 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barreland chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong u.s.dollar, dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. ""i believe the entirechemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,""oreffice said.    gaf chairman samuel heyman estimated that the u.s. chemicalindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billiondlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.    the turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemicalindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck andplanning, said paces john dosher.    dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocksdramatically cheaper and at the same time the american dollarwas weakening against foreign currencies. that helped boostu.s. chemical exports.    also helping to bring supply and demand into balance hasbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemicalmanufacturing capacity created by middle eastern oil producersin the early 1980s.    finally, virtually all major u.s. chemical manufacturershave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring programto mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminateunrelated businesses. the restructuring touched off a flurry offriendly and hostile takeover attempts.    gaf, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquireunion carbide corp <uk>, recently offered three billion dlrsfor borg warner corp <bor>, a chicago manufacturer of plasticsand chemicals. another industry powerhouse, w.r. grace <gra> has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizerbusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.    but some experts worry that the chemical industry may beheaded for trouble if companies continue turning their back onthe manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such asethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals thatare custom-designed for a small group of buyers.    ""companies like dupont <dd> and monsanto co <mtc> spent thepast two or three years trying to get out of the commoditychemical business in reaction to how badly the market haddeteriorated,"" dosher said. ""but i think they will eventuallykill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the nichemarket."" some top chemical executives share the concern.    ""the challenge for our industry is to keep from gettingcarried away and repeating past mistakes,"" gafs heymancautioned. ""the shift from commodity chemicals may beill-advised. specialty businesses do not stay special long.""    houston-based cain chemical, created this month by thesterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.    chairman gordon cain, who previously led a leveraged buyoutof duponts conoco incs chemical business, has spent 1.1billion dlrs since january to buy seven petrochemical plantsalong the texas gulf coast.    the plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals thatare the building blocks of specialty products.    ""this kind of commodity chemical business will never be aglamorous, high-margin business,"" cain said, adding that demandis expected to grow by about three pct annually.    garo armen, an analyst with dean witter reynolds, saidchemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand forplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, woodand steel products. armen estimated the upturn in the chemicalbusiness could last as long as four or five years, provided theu.s. economy continues its modest rate of growth. reuter"

""wehave the beer, but distribution and sales is the importantpoint,"" van schaik said, adding that since the ruling heinekenhad been inundated by german traders seeking joint ventures.    ""the question is not if we want to penetrate the germanmarket, but how we are to do it,"" van schaik said, adding thatwhile the widely traveled germans seemed to be developing ataste for foreign beer, the internal structure was veryregionalized.     heineken board member hans coebergh, responsible forafrican operations, said he saw africa as one of the mostimportant beer growth markets in the long term.     he said the company, present in africa since 1932 and withmajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, washampered by the lack of hard currencies there.    africa, where beer consumption averages only nine litersper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictionsand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total1986 sales.    on-site production is rendered expensive by the high priceof imports of essential ingredients. but heineken scientistshave been looking at other possibilities.    to balance the costs of imported malt, heinken launched onthe nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, whichhad sold successfully, coebergh said.    heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional rawmaterials, but coebergh noted that banana and palm beer werepopular in rwanda . ""this is a possibility, but we could notpossibly achieve the heineken flavor,"" coebergh said.    chairman heineken said the companys seven year efforts topenetrate the soviet market had finally resulted this week in acontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.    but again, a lack of hard currencies limited heinekensmarket potential. heineken now has seven bars in moscow thatare enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept westernmoney. reuter"

['trade'],15352,test,yes,deficit cuts seen unable to cure trade deficit,"financial analysts say they arepleased with congressional moves to trim next years federalbudget deficit but believe the actions will do little to helpimprove the u.s. trade deficit or buoy the economy.    the house of representatives is expected to vote tomorrowto approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the comingfiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.    similarly, the senate budget committee has approved a planthat would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs nextyear.        ""in terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs isinfinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have littleimpact on the economy and the trade deficit,"" said stanleycollander, a touche ross federal budget policy analyst.    ""at best, it will have a small positive effect,"" collandersaid in an interview.    federal reserve board chairman paul volcker has repeatedlytold congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long wayto help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help easesome of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.    the u.s. government has attempted to remedy the tradeimbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. but volckerhas warned that a further fall in the dollars value is fraughtwith danger.    such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation asimported goods become more expensive and chase away foreigncapital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.    in addition, in february, u.s. officials meeting with othermajor industrialized nations in paris agreed that the value ofthe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange ratesshould be stabilized at around current levels.    as part of that agreement, japan and west germany agreed totake steps to stimulate their economies and the united statesagreed to cut its budget deficit.    the alternative to driving down the dollar any further as away to deal with the trade deficit, volcker said recently, isto reduce u.s. consumption, particularly federal spending.    ""if you dont deal with the budget deficit, everything elseyou do is going to be counterproductive,"" volcker said in recenttestimony before the senate banking committee.    volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten thegovernments purse strings than have the fed tighten the creditsupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures orto assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the unitedstates.    analysts say that fed tightening now could choke off thecurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.    kemper financial services economist john silvia stressedthat any deficit reduction was better than none.    but he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the federal reserve board the flexibility itneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollarfrom plunging further in world exchange markets.    ""theres no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but ifyour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve thefeds flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answeris, its not enough,"" silvia told reuters.    the u.s. trade deficit has become one of the governmentsmost vexing and persistent problems.    the 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yetlittle indication that this years figure will be any lower,though administration officials have predicted it will drop byabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by years end.    in the past, volcker has joked that he never lost sleepworrying whether congress would cut too much fat from thefederal budget.    on the other hand, he also has made it clear he is notattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set forthe 1986-1991 period by last years gramm-rudman balancedbudget law.    while the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs fornext years federal deficit, both the house and senate budgetcommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fallshort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.

""central banks have sufficient experience of exchange markettransactions to steer exchange rates where they want to havethem,"" he said. he added that west german growth forecasts wouldhave to be revised downward because of the recent dollar dropto 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.    koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange marketshad parted company with transactions in goods, services andinvestments. it was the scale of speculative transactions thatdetermined market trends.    speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates togrow. to reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rateswould have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.    ""in other words, the monetary policy measures required aredifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result ofmounting economic activity,"" koehler said.    the dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive u.s.current account deficit. but attempts to keep the depreciationgoing by talking the dollar down posed problems.    the sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steeprise in the cost of u.s. imports and a sharp fall in the costof european imports. but the volume effect of falling importsto the u.s. and rising imports to europe would take time tomake itself felt compared with the price effect.    ""hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be goingfurther than would be necessary to adjust the current accountover the medium term,"" koehler said.    a reduction in the u.s. current account deficit would occuronly if the growth rate of gnp was higher than domestic demand.in japan and west germany by contrast, domestic demand shouldrise faster than gnp.    ""in germany this did indeed happen in 1986,"" koehler said.    if a further appreciation of the dollar was to beprevented, the u.s. current account deficit could be offset byan inflow of foreign funds into the u.s..    but only if there was an appropriate interest ratedifferential would europe and japan look for financialinvestment in the u.s.    when selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bankhad to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact itsmeasures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.    koehler said the bundesbank was changing money market ratesby operating on the open market rather than adjusting leadinginterest rates because of the signal this gives to the marketand its substantial impact on exchange rates.    it was not only important to achieve the domestic goals ofprice stability, economic growth and full employment but alsoto tackle international problems like the exchange rateproblem, the debt problem and the current account problem.    a strategy had to be designed that helped ""the safeguardingof non-inflationary economic growth in an internationalmonetary system largely free of disruptions,"" koehler said.    given the system of floating exchange rates, it wasnecessary for central banks to agree to intervene. it sufficedto tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates overthe next few years and intervention points should not be set,because they were only testing points for the market, he said.    in order to keep the international monetary system free ofdisruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly butalso cooperate on interest rate policies, koehler said. reuter"

""suddenly theyre standing at the centre of the worldcommunity and in that sense, theyre at a loss (as to) how toface the situation.""    most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row withlondon over efforts by britains cable and wireless plc to keepa major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete injapans lucrative overseas telephone business.    the ministry has favoured the merger of the two rivalgroups, arguing the market cannot support more than onecompetitor to kokusai denshin denwa co ltd, which nowmonopolizes the business.    it has also opposed a major management role in the plannedmerger for any non-japanese overseas telecommunications firm onthe grounds that no such international precedent exists.    the ministrys stance has outraged both london, which hasthreatened to retaliate, and washington, which says the mergerplan is evidence of japans failure to honour pledges to openits telecommunications market.    washington is also angry over other ministry moves which itsays have limited access for u.s. firms to japans cartelephone and satellite communications market.    much of mpts new prominence stems from the growth of thesector it regulates.    ""what has been happening is an important shift in theeconomy which makes the ministry a very important place,"" saidjames abegglen, head of the consulting firm asia advisoryservice inc.    a decision to open the telecommunications industry tocompetition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boostedrather than lessened mpts authority, analysts said.    ""with the legal framework eased, they became the de factolegal framework,"" said bache securities (japan) analyst darrellwhitten.    close links with the powerful political faction of theruling liberal democratic party (ldp) nurtured by former primeminister kakuei tanaka are another key to mpts influence, theanalysts said.    ""other factions ignored mpt (in the 1970s), but the tanakafaction was forward looking and ... recognized the importanceof mpt,"" uchida said. many former bureaucrats became members ofthe influential political group, he added.    the ministry also has power in the financial sector due tothe more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in thepostal savings system, analysts said.    mpt has helped block finance ministry plans to deregulateinterest rates on small deposits, a key element in financialliberalisation, since the change would remove the postalsavings systems ability to offer slightly higher rates thanbanks, they said.    diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as mptsobstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterizedthe ministry as feudal.    critics charge mpt with protecting its own turf, limitingcompetition and sheltering the former monopolies under itswing. providing consumers with the best service at the lowestprice takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.    but many of the ministrys actions are not unlike those ofits bureaucratic counterparts in much of the western worldincluding britain, several analysts said.

""the government bonds are making serious inroads on theprivate sector companies resources,"" said r. p. goenka,president of the federation of indian chambers of commerce andindustry.    ""the discriminatory tax treatment should be done away withand equal facilities be provided to the two sectors to mobiliseresources from the market which is common to both,"" goenka said.    a senior finance ministry official said government andprivate firms were free to compete to raise resources, addingit was not correct that public sector-issued bonds werepreventing private firms from raising money on the stockmarket.    ""debentures and equity shares floated by private companiesstill account for at least 60 pct of total capital raised instock exchanges,"" the ministry official said.    a spokesman at bombay stock brokers batliwala and karanisaid government bonds were valued at about 20 billion rupees orabout 40 pct of 50 billion rupees raised by both government andnon-government firms in the domestic capital market in 1986/87.    the share was 35 to 40 pct of about 36.95 billion rupeesmobilised in 1985/86, he said. ""to save taxes, commercial banks,mainly foreign banks, and some private companies, are investingtheir surplus funds in the tax free bonds,"" he said.    ""individuals who are very well off are also investing in thebonds to gain tax benefits while only small investors are goingfor equities or debentures floated by private companies on aselective basis,"" the spokesman said.    the maturity period of government company bonds variesbetween seven and 10 years. no wealth or income taxes arepayable on nine pct seven-year bonds but those carrying 13 pctinterest on 10-year bonds are subjected to income tax if interest amount^mexceeds 7,000 rupees a year.    equity shares, the 14 pct non-convertible debentures and12.5 to 14 pct convertible debentures issued by privatecompanies are not exempted from either the wealth tax or fromthe tax on income earned from them.    the government bonds are listed as securities but traded onindias four major stock exchanges. they can be sold freely onthe stock market by simple endorsement while debentures canonly be sold to the company after one year, brokers said.    government companies are trying to capitalise on a boom inthe stock market since 1984/85 sparked by liberal taxconcessions and reforms in exchange operations, brokers said.    the national thermal power corp, ntpc, was the firstgovernment company to issue the bonds to raise one billionrupees in january last year, breaking the monopoly of privatecompanies on the capital market. the seven-year ntpc bond wasoversubscribed three times, brokers said.    official figures show bonds floated by government companieshave been heavily oversubscribed. more state companies havesought the ministrys permission to issue them in comingmonths.    ntpcs second bond issue at the end of 1986 raised 4.51billion rupees against 1.2 billion originally permitted by thefinance ministry.    the mahanagar telephone nigam mobilised 3.83 billion rupeeslast year against authorised 1.5 billion and last month theindian railway finance corporations record susbcriptiontotalled 5.5 billion rupees against authorised 2.5 billion.    in most cases, the government has allowed the companies tomaintain the oversubscribed amount, brokers said.    goenka said that government bonds are making itincreasingly difficult for private companies to launch newequity or debenture issues. he said the government could atleast ""fix a suitable limit on the funds to be raised throughsuch bonds by the public sector.""    merchant bankers said the government is pressing statecompanies to borrow from the public by reducing financialsupport to them.    to ease its internal debt burden, the government hasreduced the budgetary support to development investment inabout 120 public sector companies to 69.92 billion rupees in1987/88 from 77.92 billion a year earlier, official figuresshow. reuter"

""i would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the pastseveral weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in thediscussions in paris,"" miyazawa said yesterday.    the supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs wasannounced by the ruling liberal democratic party on the eve ofmiyazawas departure for washington, to attend yesterdaysmeetings of leading industrial nations.    in a strongly worded statement terming the japanese action""extraordinary and urgent"", the meeting reaffirmed the parisaccord by noting that current exchange rates are within rangesbroadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.    the group of seven -- the united states, japan, westgermany, france, britain, italy and canada -- thereforerepeated their willingness to continue close cooperation tofoster exchange rate stability.    the cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted centralbank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt thedollars fall. while relatively unsuccessful, the scale ofintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recentyears. monetary sources also said they understood thatsecretary baker considered the meeting to be extremelysuccessful in the light of the japanese announcement.    they also said there was a growing feeling among thefinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation overmedium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-termdifferences in past meetings.    west germany, whose currency has not risen anything likethe yen since the paris agreement, appears from the face ofyesterdays statement to have won acceptance from othercountries that its exchange rate is acceptable.    bonns finance minister gerhard stoltenberg argues thatmajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalancebetween west germany and japans trade surpluses and americastrade deficit have already taken place.    no mention was made, however, of the u.s. commitment to cutthe budget deficit even though it is implied in thereafffirmation of paris.    european nations and japan believe deficit cuts areessential to curbing the record u.s. trade shortfall thatreached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.    a similar argument was made on capitol hill earlier thisweek by federal reserve board chairman paul volcker. a furthersharp fall to redress trade imbalances would ""clearly posesubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and couldundermine confidence in future financial stability,"" he said.    volcker warned a further dollar fall might force thepolitically independent fed to drive up interest rates.    monetary sources said that, privately, west germanywelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its owncurrency remained relatively stable against the u.s. unit.    bonn and other european nations worry that once the weakdollar blunts tokyos export drive to the united states, thejapanese monolith will concentrate on european markets.    the ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on makingtheir policy coordination more binding and one, canadianfinance minister michael wilson, said good progress was made.    wilson said they will meet before the june economic summitto prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.    the united states and france, backed by the internationalmonetary fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or ""norms"" for alimited number of economic objectives such as growth,inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and currentaccount balances.    sharp deviations from these guidelines would result inconsultations between the countries on whether correctiveaction should be required.    but the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectiveshas bonn and london worried, monetary sources say, because itimplies washington is moving in the direction of target zones.    the sources said the reagan administration unsuccessfullysounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limitcurrency fluctuations just before the february meeting.    the concept is a much more rigid one than the secret rangesof the paris accord and would mark a sharp departure from therelatively free currency markets of recent years. reuter"

['strategic-metal'],15872,test,yes,house panel wants pentagon manage u.s. stockpile,"the house armed services committeehas voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiledmaterials for national defense to the u.s. defense secretary.    the committee also voted for legally-binding quantity andquality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.    the measures are a part of the defense authorization billwhich will be voted on in the house next month.    the purpose of the measures, passed by the committeeyesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discouragesell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, astaff member of the committee told reuters.    ""they (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by beingmanaged properly,"" said the staffer. ""management of the stockpileover the last 10 years has been atrocious.""    responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to awhite house agency, the federal emergency management agency.    the staffer said that under the measures passed by thecommittee the secretary of defense would have more influenceover decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.    the administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrsworth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. thestockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.    he said several agencies currently helped fema to managethe stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.    these agencies included the office of management and budgetand the departments of interior and commerce, he said.    the committee believed the shared involvement in stockpilemanagement was counter-productive, he said. reuter"

""the long term growth in dependency on foreign oil isinevitable,"" lichtblau said. as much as 30 pct of u.s. oilimports in 1995 could come from opec nations, he said.    lichtblau said the u.s. depended on foreign suppliers for33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to40 pct by 1990.    ""however, the rate of this growth can be affectedpositively or negatively through government action orinaction,"" lichtblau said.    he said that one of the governments negative actions isthe maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as adisincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cashflow for oil exploration.    lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floorprice for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.    ""an international floor price adopted by all or mostindustrial countries would clearly be a much more effectivemeasure and would be much less distortive for the u.s. than ifwe imposed it alone,"" lichtblau said.    development of alternate energy sources such as syntheticfuels as well as increased development in alaska could lessenu.s. dependency on foreign oil, lichtblau said.    a potential for alternative supplies could limit thewillingness of opec nations to raise oil prices, he said.    lichtblau also called for the federal government to offertax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the strategicpetroleum reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plansfor alternative energy. reuter"

""well be back in position in first place within threeyears,"" komatsu said in an interview.    he said that while the merger will initially reducesumitomos profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expandsumitomos branch network in the tokyo metropolitan area whereit has been relatively weak.    but financial analysts are divided on whether and howquickly the gamble will pay off.    some said sumitomo may have paid too much for heiwa sogo inview of the smaller banks large debts. others argue the mergerwas more cost effective than creating a comparable branchnetwork from scratch.    the analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. it hasexpanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities businessand geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned thewisdom of some of those moves.    ""theyve made bold moves to put everything in place. nowits largely out of their hands,"" said kleinwort benson ltdfinancial analyst simon smithson.    among sumitomos problems are limits placed on its move toenter u.s. securities business by taking a share in americaninvestment bank goldman, sachs and co.    sumitomo last august agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being atleast, the federal reserve board has forbidden them to exchangepersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other.    ""the tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because thefed was stricter than sumitomo expected,"" said one analyst.    but komatsu said the move will pay off in time.    ""u.s. regulations will change in the near future and if so,we can do various things. we only have to wait two or threeyears, not until the 21st century,"" komatsu said.    komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routesinto the securities business at home.    article 65 of the securities and exchange act, japansversion of the u.s. glass-steagall act, separates commercialfrom investment banking.    but the walls between the two are crumbling and komatsusaid he hopes further deregulation will create newopportunities.    ""we need to find new business chances,"" komatsu said. ""in somecases these will be securities related, in some cases trustbank related. thats the kind of deregulation we want.""    until such changes occur, sumitomo will focus on suchdomestic securities business as profitable government bonddealing and strengthening relations with meiko securities coltd, in which it holds a five pct share, komatsu said.    he said sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about enteringthe securities business here through its swiss universal banksubsidiary, banca del gottardo.     the finance ministry is expected to grant licences tosecurities subsidiaries of u.s. commercial banks soon,following a similar decision for subsidiaries of europeanuniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.    but komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similardecision on a gottardo subsidiary.    ""we dont want to make waves. we expect this will be allowedin two or three years,"" he said.    like other city banks, sumitomo is also pushing to expandlending to individuals and small and medium businesses toreplace disappearing demand from big business, he added.    the analysts said sumitomo will have to devote a lot oftime to digesting its most recent initiatives, including themerger with ailing heiwa sogo.

"['interest', 'money-fx']",14890,test,yes,economic spotlight - australian markets booming,"australian markets are booming as foreignfund managers redirect capital away from the united states andother traditional markets, analysts said.    high short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market andan increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow offresh funds in the last two months, largely from japanese andu.s. investors, analysts polled by reuters said.    fund managers want quality markets to park their cash inand have settled on australia, britain and canada as theydiversify from volatile u.s. dollar instruments, they said.    a one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates inthe past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for thecurrency of 0.71 u.s. dlrs all illustrated the inflow.    official figures on the latest inflow of investment capitalare not available, but brokers said they received almost dailyinquiries from japan and the united states.

""they are giving us the benefit of the doubt and i thinkthey would like to leave the money here,"" buttrose said.    reserve bank policy has also reflected the increasedinterest in investment in australia and the need to shieldjapanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.    reserve governor bob johnston last week acknowledged anelement of targeting the rate against the yen in currencypolicy when he said authorities could not take their ""eyes offthe yen"" because of the crucial role of japanese investors.    analysts said they believed the reserve bank had workedsuccessfully in recent months to keep the australian dollarwithin the range of 100 to 103 yen.    apart from its recovery against a weak u.s. dollar, theaustralian dollar has also risen almost three pct on atrade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.    offshore buying has also played a role in the boomingaustralian share market. it has followed wall street and othermarkets, but is also setting its own trend in response to theweight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring intoequities, particularly in the gold sector.    the key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, whilethe gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in thesame period.    the property sector is also sought after, with japanesecompanies that have invested heavily in the united states inrecent years turning their attention to undervalued realestate, particularly in the tourism field.    analysts pointed to the recent sale of sydneys five-starregent hotel to japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrsas indicative of the type of property being sought.

"['gnp', 'cpi']",14891,test,yes,economic spotlight - kuwaiti economy,"kuwaits oil-reliant and debt-riddeneconomy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil priceswill determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economistssay.    crucial will be the ability of the 13-member opec to holdoil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in thenorthern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.    bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of grossdomestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last yearafter contracting 8.1 pct the year before.    this was after taking into account inflation in consumerprices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.    factors depressing economic activity include the6-1/2-year-old iran-iraq war on kuwaits doorstep, whichthreatens the emirates vital oil export lifeline through thegulf and has sapped business confidence.    but sentiment received a much-needed boost in septemberwhen, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisiscaused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensivenew debt settlement program was introduced.    the share crash, result of a speculative spree in forwardtrading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.    the cheques were also used as collateral for consumerspending, thus generating an informal credit system.    much of the debt has been watered down but big sums arestill owed by individuals and companies.    there was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of whichone-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank asbad or doubtful debt. but the government has repeatedly said itwill not allow any banks to go under.    the new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling ofproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whetherdebtors have regular cash flows or not.    banks shareholders and depositors will have their rightsguaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significancein a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sectoris the biggest after oil.    kuwait is better placed than any other opec country to rideout the oil glut, bankers and economists say.    kuwait has an opec quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned lastyear by oil minister sheikh ali al-khalifa al-sabah.    but strategic diversification into downstream operations ineurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment athome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sellover one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.    oil industry sources say kuwait is able to get an average2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processedproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than ascrude.    bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reasonfor cautious optimism. other reasons are low domesticinflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recentyears and signs government spending on productive sectors willremain steady.    external accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct belowthat for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hitgulf.    kuwaits petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were putofficially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment incomeof the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.    but for the first time since the end of the oil boom, thesereserves may not be enough to prevent a ""real"" budget deficit forthe 1986/87 fiscal year ending june 30, bankers say.    in a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.    this left out income from state reserves, usually excludedin official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers atup to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in someshortfall.    bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast foreconomic growth this year or next.    ""it depends on oil prices,"" one said. ""this summer isimportant.""    cabinet affairs minister rashid al-rashid said last sundaythe cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise statespending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate theeconomy.    he gave no details but bankers say these are expected to bespelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in june. reuter"

""a further appreciation of the mark could even be anobstacle to further growth,"" he said.    poehl said the bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supplygrowth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation andbecause external factors, including low oil prices andfavourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.    but poehl said west germany now faced a difficult dilemmaover monetary policy.    the underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not thereported negative inflation rates last year, and west germanywas affected more than before by exchange rate developments.    ""for the time being, we will have to focus our policy moreon the external side, and we can live with a more expansionarymoney supply. but we must be very careful,"" he said.    he said he shared some of the u.s. concern about japanstrade surpluses, which affected european countries as well asthe united states.    poehl welcomed the so-called louvre accord of monetaryofficials of major industrialized countries, saying theimportance of the february 22 agreement to stabilize exchangerates had been underestimated.    all partners had agreed that the dollar was at about theright level, and that further changes would damage growth, hesaid.

""m-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,"" said bill sullivanof dean witter reynolds inc.    while m-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator ofeconomic growth, sullivan said fed officials might be concernedthe latest drop in m-1 means another month of sluggish growthin the broader monetary aggregates, m-2 and m-3, which are seenas better gauges of economic growth.    latest monthly m-2 and m-3 data showed that as of may, bothmeasures were growing at rates below the bottom of the feds5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.    if money growth does not accelerate, fed officials,concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.    ""does this mean that the fed abandons its current openmarket position? no,"" sullivan said. ""but does this mean the endof tightening for the time being? definitely yes.""    economists said average adjusted discount window borrowingsof 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement periodwere lower than they had expected. most believed the fed hadtargetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.    but they said that if it had not been for a large one-daynet miss in the feds reserve projections, the higherborrowings target would probably have been reached.    a drop in may u.s. housing starts and continued weakness inauto sales show key sectors of the u.s. economy are lagging,while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in may producer prices hashelped dispel inflation fears, slifer said.    ""if this continues, we can entertain the notion of fedeasing at some point,"" he said.    other economists said the fed would probably pay littleattention to weak money supply growth. ""it has been a number ofyears since m-1 has given good signs of whats going on in theeconomy,"" one said. ""i dont think m-1 shows that the economy isfalling apart and the fed should ease.""    economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be aprerequisite for any move by the fed toward easier monetarypolicy.    they said the fed is reluctant to lower short-term ratesfor fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar andhigher inflation which would push up long-term yields and chokeoff econmomic growth.    but sullivan said the dollar has been steady since lateapril. ""the fed has to determine if this represents afundamental change for the dollar. if it does, then this givesthem more room to ease,"" he said. reuter"

['interest'],19191,test,yes,u.k. lenders offer more fixed rate mortgages,"more u.k. lenders are offering homebuyersfixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makesthe same monthly payment no matter what happens to otherinterest rates.    and with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels inyears, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyerstrying to lock into cheap money.    the decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officialssaid, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the homemortgage business.    while fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the u.k., theywere the mainstay of the business in the u.s. up until only afew years ago.    but in the early 1980s interest rates soared. u.s. lenders,mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as lowas three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in theirportfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct toinduce them to retain their accounts.    as a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or wereforced to merge. the survivors decided to offer mortgages whoserates would move in line with the cost of funds.    ""we very much have the example of the u.s. thrifts in mind,""said a spokesman for abbey national building society,explaining why his institution, for the time being, is onlyoffering variable rate mortgages.    the rash of advertising to solicit new business has helpedhomebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lendersconcede they are being forced to undercut each other stillmore.    sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlierthis week by the nations two largest building societies and bynational westminster bank plc reflect growing competition fornew business, officials at all three institutions said.    the fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates evenbelow those on the variable rate loans.    ""of course they are less profitable than other (variablerate) mortgages,"" said a spokesman for midland bank plc, whichearlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed ratenew mortgage loans.    but he said the bank is willing to offer less profitableloans because, ""it was just another way to attract people to ourmortgage product.""    trustee savings bank plc (tsb) was offering five year fixedrate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.    the 100 mln stg that tsb set aside for the loans wasexhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.    ""everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,"" she said, notingthat within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pctof its 1986 volume.    in short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that theyoffer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interestrates. if interest rates fall after the mortgage is made thelender is earning an above average return on assets.    but if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has wonthe benefit of cheap money.    household mortgage co had planned to offer a 25 year fixedrate mortgage after the june 11 elections on the assumptionthat a conservative party victory would help money market ratesfall further, according to duncan young, managing director.    young explained that the company had planned to protectitself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying acomplicated hedging instrument.    but money market rates have risen contrary to expectationsand the company has shelved its plans for the time being. hesaid money market rates were too high to arrange both themortgages and hedge profitably.    however, he said that when the household mortgage co doesmake fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. thismeans bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bondand selling them to an investor.    for technical reasons securitisation is simpler and moreefficient with fixed rate rather than with floating ratemortgages. in the u.s., where fixed rate mortgages are popularagain, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage moneyover the past few years. reuter"

['crude'],19285,test,yes,u.s. oil prices strong ahead of opec meeting,"u.s. crude oil prices are at theirhighest level in more than a year ahead of next weeks opecmeeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect anypolicy changes from the session.    they said prices, which have steadily climbed since theorganizations accord in december, have risen on technicalfactors within the market and concerns about supplies becauseof the iran-iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from thegulf.    the u.s. benchmark crude west texas intermediate is tradingaround 20.55 dlrs in the july contract on new york mercantileexchanges energy futures and in the spot market. that is itshighest level since january 1986.    opec conference president rilwanu lukman, who is nigeriasoil minister, said friday he expects the meeting in vienna tobe brief and calm and that opecs current price and productionagreement may only need a slight review.    although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmationof the december agreement, oil prices continue to climb due toa desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.    analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soonafter the opec meeting. at that point, barring any increasedtension in the gulf or changes in opecs policies, pricesshould begin easing.    ""opec will probably not do anything it hasnt already agreedto in december because oil prices are firm,"" said john hill, avice president at merrill lynch futures.    opec agreed in december to maintain official oil prices at18 dlrs a barrel and raise the groups production ceiling to16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mlnbarrels in the fourth quarter.    this agreement helped send prices sharply higher, risingfrom 15 dlrs a barrel in early december.    several opec members who are price hawks, including iran,algeria and libya, will seek a higher official price and areduction in output.    ""and if u.s. west texas intermediate crude continues totrade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance thatopec will raise its official 18 dlrs price,"" said naumanbarakat, analyst at smith barney, harris upham and co.    but most analysts expect the more moderate producers, suchas saudi arabia, to block any changes in policy.    ""the meeting will be a non-event with no change in theofficial prices because opec, and in particular the saudis, arecommitted to stabilizing the market,"" said rosario ilacqua,analyst with l.f. rothschild.    however, some analysts said opec may need to hold a meetingin september to re-evaluate market conditions.    overproduction by opec will become a real problem in thefourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels aday and iraqs pipeline through turkey brings another 500,000barrels to the market each day, said john lichtblau, presidentof petroleum industry ressearch foundation.    most expect saudi arabia to oppose a price increase at thismeeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs tooffset the decline in the dollar. oil prices are denominatedthroughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,producers receive less money for their oil.    ""the only real production restraint in opec is saudi arabia,""said sanford margoshes, analyst at shearson lehman brothers.    ""in the second half of the year we expect the saudis not toproduce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore actas a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a twodlrs a barrel price increase at the december 1987 meeting,"" hesaid.    one uncertain factor is the course of the iran-iraq war.    ""the wild card is the increased tensions in the persiangulf,"" said frank knuettel, analyst with prudential-bachesecurites.    oil tankers taking oil from iraq and kuwait have beenregular targets for iranian planes. the reagan administrationis planning to put kuwait tankers under the protection of theu.s. flag, with naval escorts.

""brazil has been the most strongly against any change in theformula because it feared a lower quota. but our proposalleaves it very little to object to,"" van horick said.    ""the existing quota system is far too rigid and does notreflect supply and demand reality,"" he said. ""our formulabuilds flexibility into the system and will benefit almosteveryone.""    although full implications of the new formula have still tobe worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such ascolombia, kenya, indonesia and costa rica would get slightlyhigher quotas, while others such as the ivory coast, elsalvador and nicaragua would lose quota share, van horick said.    because the proposal provides that future quotadistribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, itshould also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doingso would automatically prejudice their following years quota.    ""if the ico consumers accept our proposal it stands at leasta fair chance of being accepted by the producers at theseptember meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of anew quota formula, "" van horick said.    at the same time much will depend on brazils attitude.

trading scandal, wild stockprice gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from theglobalization of financial markets.    david ruder, a 58-year-old republican law professor atnorthwestern university in evanston, ill., was named thursdayto be the 23rd chairman of the five-member u.s. securities andexchange commission.    if confirmed by the senate, as expected, he will succeedjohn shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a recordsix years as chairman to become ambassador to the netherlands.    the sec has been in the limelight for the past year as itsinvestigators have probed into the most colossal insidertrading scandal ever uncovered on wall street.    the investigation, which is still active, mushroomed inrecent months as a growing number of well known traders andprominent investment banking firms have been charged withwrongdoing.    the pace of the probe picked up markedly in november afterivan boesky, one of wall streets most successful stockspeculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigatorsand to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegalprofits after being charged with insider trading.    but the agency is also wrestling with a vexing newphenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred bycomputer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities, options and futures. the price gyrations havecombined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedentedvolatility to some u.s. securities markets.    at the same time, the sec is being pressed by somelawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporatetakeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeoverssteadily reshapes the u.s. corporate landscape.    and the agency is being pushed by u.s. and foreignexchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundworkfor an international securities marketplace in which tradingoccurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.    such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investmentopportunities but could strain the secs ability to enforceu.s. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.    under the leadership of shad, the sec eased financialdisclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted tospur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agencysreview of hostile corporate takeovers.    shad, who had been vice chairman of the e. f. huttoninvestment banking firm, brought a wall street perspective tothe agency upon being named chairman in 1981.    in line with the views of other top administrationofficials, he favored marketplace determination of takeoverbattles over new federal regulations.    the sec under shad also stressed prosecution of insidertrading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases thattopped the agencys enforcement agenda during theadministration of president jimmy carter, a democrat.    securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted withruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely tosignificantly alter the commissions current priorities.    the sec currently has about 2,000 employees, most of themlawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though thatfigure likely will be significantly higher next year as theagency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.    the agency is one of the few in the government thatactually has taken in more money than it has spent in the pastfew years because of fees it charges public companies,investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.    the sec is structured as an independent regulatory agency,meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by thepresident to fixed five-year terms and protected from firingfor policy differences alone.    by law, no more than three commissioners may be of the samepolitical party, and the agency prepares its own budget requesteach year instead of leaving this to the white house.    established by congress in 1934, the sec traces its originsto the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributedin large part to widespread trading on credit and attemptedmarket manipulations by large investment firms.    the agency requires public companies and investmentvehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports ontheir financial condition and to disclose changes in theircondition any time they issue new securities.    it requires brokers, dealers and investment banks toregister with it and comply with investor protection rules, andit polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.    its first chairman was joseph kennedy, an industrialmagnate who was also the father of john kennedy, later tobecome the nations 35th president.    other former chairmen include william douglas, who servedfrom 1937 until his appointment to the u.s. supreme court in1939, and william casey, who served during president nixonsfirst term and was reagans director of the centralintelligence agency until his death

""these factors raise the question: is there enough strengthto keep the economy from tipping into a recession?"" said lylegramley, chief economist of the mortgage bankersassociation and a former federal reserve board official.    the commerce department said this week that the economygrew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, buta u.s. monetary official called it a weak report.    housing starts fell 2.7 pct in may, and consumer spendingrose a weak 0.1 per cent.    ""our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, ""martin mauro, senior economist for merrill lynch economics,told reuters.    gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slowbecause inflation is rising faster than real wages.    to offset this, u.s. exports must continue to rise,returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boostpersonal income and consumption, he says.    ""i expect to see enough improvement in real net exports tokeep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,""gramley said.    federal reserve board governor martha seger told reportersthat the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was theresult of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not lastand said the recovery was showing anemia.    seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, ""the paceof the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored intomonetary policy"" - possibly a signal that the fed will beaccommodative.    most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pctforecast by the reagan administration for 1987 and warn that ifthe dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and addto the risk of a recession.    mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in maycame despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where aninventory overhang still exists.    he says the boost in production came from smallerindustries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which haveimproved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.    ""they are not going to be enough for any kind of surge ineconomic activity, but i think they will keep us out of arecession,"" mauro said.    in a speech to financial planners this week, berylsprinkel, the chief white house economic adviser, predicted thetrade deficit will continue to improve.    ""prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 andinto 1988 are still quite favorable,"" he said.    but private economists raise concerns about a resurgence ininflation.    allen sinai, chief economist at shearson lehman brothersinc., told congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 aftera 1.1 pct increase in 1986.    the rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oiland energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.    ""the lesson of history is that once the inflation genie getsout of the bottle, it continues to persist,"" he said, adding hewould like the fed to tighten credit.    a major factor affecting inflation is the value of thedollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, saysa prominent international banker.    rainer gut, chairman of credit suisse, told the nationalpress club that the dollars downward trend against the yen andthe mark will continue for years because the united states isthe worlds largest debtor nation.    the swiss banker said the economic indicators point to afurther slackening of activity and called naive the belief thatthe five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.""it is very difficult to be optimistic,"" gut said. reuter"

""as iran knows very well, what america is bringing into thegulf could do serious damage,"" said one western diplomat.    diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attackson ""soft targets"" such as merchant shipping not protected byamerican or other western navy vessels patrolling the gulf.    the risk of iranian attack on u.s. warships or kuwaiti oiltankers carrying the u.s. flag and under naval escort is ratedby diplomats as low. however, ""there is the threat that theiranians, seeing these heavily protected u.s.-flag tankers,will go for softer targets,"" one diplomat said.    tehran radio quoted irans top defence spokesman ali akbarhashemi rafsanjani as saying yesterday that washington was""moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.""    the u.s. is increasing its gulf fleet from seven to 10warships and sending the refurbished battleship missouri topatrol just outside the strait of hormuz.    the build-up ties in with u.s. plans to start escortingkuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registeredto fly the american flag to give them naval protection.    shipping serving kuwait has come under repeated attack byiran, angered at the emirates war backing of iraq.    concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed bychinese-made silkworm missiles, which the u.s. says iran ispreparing to deploy near the strait of hormuz.    the missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely tomake iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.    a military source in the gulf has said iran also set up alaunching site for the silkworms on captured iraqi soil in thefaw peninsula, within range of kuwait.    ""but anything that went as far as a direct attack on kuwaititerritory would be a very serious escalation"" likely movingworld opinion against iran, remarked one.    some diplomats believe iran could also consider carryingout reprisals against the united states outside the gulf.    rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predictedlast friday ""a river of blood"" throughout the world in the eventof any u.s. strike against iran.    western diplomats said iran, which washington has accusedof being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrablecapacity to carry out attacks in the u.s. itself.    diplomats saw few potential targets in lebanon now thatmost americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked topro-iranian groups. but europe and asia were potentialtrouble-spots, and kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.    any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage orother action to make it difficult to blame iran, they added. reuter"

""i am convinced that israel exports to the u.s. can reachfive billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn tofunction in the american marketplace and place greater emphasison product quality,"" yaacobi said.    while the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis europeancurrencies is a ""bottleneck to increasing exports to the u.s.,""yaacobi said he expects israel to extend its recent trendtoward higher u.s. exports.    in the last ten years, israeli exports to the u.s. rosefivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, whileimports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.    yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pctannually, the rate achieved until the 1973 yom kippur war.     he said that the u.s./israel free trade agreement, passedlast year and eliminating all duties and other commercialrestrictions between the two nations through 1994, wouldcontinue to facilitate the desired export growth.    dual agreements included in the fta allow israel to act asan economic bridge between the u.s. and europe, enabling u.s.firms to export to europe at lower cost if a certain percentageof the exported is produced in israel, and vice-versa.    yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middleeast was one of the main reasons israel had not yet been ableto achieve its economic potential.    since 1973 the u.s. has given israel 25 billion dlrs inaid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financingmilitary conflicts ""which were imposed on israel,"" he said.    short of achieving israels full growth potential, however,yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economicindependence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption thatexports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period. reuter"

""they have set this signal and indicated they could maybelower market rates even further, but not with the discount orlombard,"" winfried hutmann, chief economist of schroeder,munchmeyer, hengst investment gmbh said.    werner chrobok, managing partner at bethmann bank, saidgerman rates were among the lowest in industrial countries andaround historical lows for west germany.    a further cut in rates would have little impact on theeconomy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,with companies swimming in liquidity, chrobok said.    the bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a moveon interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.""the bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,"" he said.    a cut in the discount or lombard rates, to bring them inline with the new structure of money market rates since lastmonth, would have little practical significance, dealers said.    the bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted adiplomatic gesture before next weeks venice summit.    but bundesbank president karl otto poehl has often made itclear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere ""eyewash.""    economists said it was really up to the bonn government tocut taxes, rather than for the bundesbank to ease monetarypolicy, to meet pressure on west germany at the venice summit.    but with bonn struggling to finance already announced taxcuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budgetdeficit, it is hard to see how bonn could cut taxes further.    ""the bonn government will be in a very weak position invenice because they cant risk increasing the deficit further,""said schroeder, muenchmeyer, hengsts hutmann.    bethmanns chrobok said if anything is to happen beforevenice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. ""but idont expect any convincing measures,"" he said.    money market dealers noted that call money continued tonormalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterdayand as much as five pct on friday when it was pushed up bymonth-end distortions.    call money could come under upwards pressure later thismonth because of a major round of tax payments by banks onbehalf of customers, starting in the week beginning june 15.two public holidays that week could also distort the market.    dealers said they expected the bundesbank to allocate fundstomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.    but dealers said it was possible the bundesbank wouldallocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. that would notrepresent a tightening of policy, however.    because the bundesbank scales down bids which it allocatesat the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a fullallocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.    on another issue, poehl has said the bundesbank is likelyto lift restrictions on private use of the european currencyunit (ecu) at one of its meetings soon.    saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcementon this gesture to european unity, as it is the capital of thesaarland bordering france, and was twice under frenchoccupation this century.    but dealers said an ecu announcement was unlikely to comethis week, as a number of technical and legal matters had stillto be resolved, for instance how german ecu accounts would betreated for minimum reserve purposes. reuter"

""all opec members can make a good case for changingdifferentials,"" said one analyst with a major oil company. ""butat the end of the day, the attitude is going to be ""leave wellalone and little or nothing is likely to be altered.""    iran, libya and saudi arabia are among those who also sawsales problems earlier this year, traders say. but diminishedcustomer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,marketing incentives have helped their sales.    some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes bymeans of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongsidebetter priced grades in a ""package.""    many opec crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at leastfor some part of the year. but many experts say opec shouldchange prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand forfuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. atits last meeting in december, opec agreed to reintroduce fixedprices from february 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel referencepoint. official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985when members offered discounts to attract customers.    opec also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarterand 18.3 mln for the fourth. analysts expect it will now extendor raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.    spot market and netback values for some crudes do notmirror official prices, but opec will probably keep the 18 dlrtarget and at most make minimal changes to differentials,analysts say.    the 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six opec and onenon-opec crudes. opec assigned prices to its other key exportcrudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.extra heavy crudes were among those left out.    industry estimates vary on the proportion of opec oilexports actually sold at official prices. several experts sayonly one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells atofficial prices, with some of the rest included in processingor barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.    problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,when some producers output fell due to customer reluctance topay the new prices.   nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich bonny light crude-- now opecs highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --was uncompetitive on the spot market against britains brent.    in february and march, nigerias production shrank belowits 1.238 mln bpd opec quota. spot prices have since revived,due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output hasrisen.    some experts feel bonny light is still overvalued and sayits price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.    but mehdi varzi, chief oil analyst with londons kleinwortgrieveson securities, doubts nigeria will actively push thedifferentials question in vienna.    ""it would not look good for opec unity if nigeria, whichholds the presidency, raised the issue,"" he said. reuter"

""the commission believes that hostile reactions (to theproposed tax) have for the most part been based on incompleteor an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,"" he said.    tanghe said the proposed system conforms with generalagreement on tariffs and trade, gatt, rules.    it would not be discriminatory because it would be appliedto domestic and imported products, and past experience showedit would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.    ec-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they dounder present aid arrangements, he said.    the competitiveness between different oils, whether ecproduced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantitiesimported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,tanghe said.    the proposed system would not alter the ec nationsrequirements as far as imports are concerned since the overalleffect would stabilise community production levels withoutaffecting demand, he said.    it is one of the proposals objectives to maintain currentimport levels, he said.    imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they areimported primarily to satisfy the ecs cakes and mealsrequirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.furthermore, more than half the oil produced from importedbeans is re-exported to third countries, tanghe added. reuter"

""we are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financialyear, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes dueto greater availability of spares and equipment,"" a zccmofficial said.    zccm officials said the production of cobalt, anotherstrategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand.    finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonneshigher than the previous year and the best production achievedto date.    protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copperindustry in zambia, the worlds fifth biggest producer. miningis monopolised by zccm and accounts for about 90 pct of thecountrys foreign exchange earnings.    production has also been seriously affected in recent yearsby equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages ofspare parts, fuel and lubricants. the 463,354 tonnes outputlast year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.    a five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984by zccm is being funded by the european community, the africandevelopment bank and the world bank.    the plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining andmetallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.    zccm, the second largest employer after the government, hassaid it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce aspart of the plan.    more than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into theindustry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability underthe five-year restructuring plan.    company officials said although reserves were beingdepleted, zambia could continue to produce copper beyond theend of the century, though at lower levels of production.    industry sources said zccms projected pre-tax profit forthe financial year ended march 31 would be around 500 mlnkwacha. but with the current mineral export tax level beinglevied, a net loss is likely to be registered.    zccm recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 comparedwith a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.    under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in1985, zccms profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose asthe value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just overtwo to the dollar.    but on may 1, president kenneth kaunda abolished theauctioning system, inspired by the international monetary fund,and announced zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economicstrategy based on national resources.    zccm officials are still cautious over what effects thebreak with the imf will have on the industrys plans.    ""we are still consulting to see how the new measures willaffect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fareunder the new situation,"" peter hansen, director of operationsand third in the zccm hierarchy, told reuters.    some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchangerate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit zccms exportprofits.

""growth in consumer spending in the united states will dropdramatically this year because the jump in inflation will causea falloff in the growth of disposable income,"" van dyke said.    growth in u.s. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.    the report was released before the commerce departmentreported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in may,after increasing 0.4 pct in april, and that personalconsumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared witha 0.6 pct increase the month before.    the rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boostconsumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9pct in 1986, bank of america forecast.    this rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.    as a result, van dyke calculated that the purchasing powerof an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrsthis year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.    the slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housingstarts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.

""but these companies are not unwitting victims of thetake-or-pay dispute between transco and producers,"" he said.    distributors have turned a deaf ear to transcos requestfor an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facilityfor spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.    without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas willthreaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting toalternative fuels, he said.    in absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from thefederal energy regulatory commission, the matter is beingnegotiated between pipelines and customers, richards said.    now that transco has refused to transport cheap spot gasfor them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatoryon the inventory charge, he said.

['interest'],20048,test,yes,tokyo stock plunge could force easier money policy,"plunging tokyo stock prices will preventthe bank of japan from raising its discount rate and could evenforce it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,government and private economists said.    a rise in interest rates now would only serve to sparkfurther selling of shares that could ultimately have a majordeflationary impact on the real economy, they said.    although bank of japan officials have consistentlymaintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discountrate, many in the markets have thought otherwise.     fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by thecentral banks apparent decision last week to countenancehigher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.    but todays stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15pct -- means that the bank of japan would be hard pressed toraise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about arenewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.    japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as themarkets concluded that the stock markets collapse precludedthe central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discountrate increase.    a senior government economist suggested that both the u.s.and japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent afurther drop in new york and tokyo stock prices. ""they need tosupport the stock and security markets,"" he said.    but bank of japan officials said they saw no need to changepolicy for the moment, although one admitted that the centralbank may have to rethink its strategy if tokyo stock pricescontinue to plunge during the rest of the week.    both government and bank of japan economists agreed theeconomy is better placed now to cope with the deflationaryimpact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.    with the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop instock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer andbusiness confidence, one government economist said.    ""there will be some impact on the real economy, but it wontbe that big,"" said another.    individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on theirown, although they do participate through trust funds and otherinvestment vehicles. and while many manufacturing firms turnedto financial market investments for profits during last yearseconomic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them torefocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.    paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that ispartly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies haveshifted funds away from financial investments to increaseinventories and step up capital spending, one governmenteconomist said.    in deciding what response to make to the steep stock pricedrop, the bank of japan must first determine whether priceswill continue to fall further and then decide if they pose agreater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,one central bank official said.

""many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because ofthe past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as itbecame a matter of the trade monitoring each other,"" oneanalyst said.    on monday, a national coffee association newsletter saidthe office of u.s. trade representative will implement avoluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation tomonitor imports is tied up in the congressional trade bill.    under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffeeimporters would voluntarily present needed documents to theu.s. government until congress approves the monitoringauthority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,it will still be allowed entry.    while many believe producers will not seek to add to theoverburdened stock situation in the u.s., others believe somewill ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu ofmonitoring controls, trade sources said.    ""last time, there was a lot of false information submittedto customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,"" au.s. customs spokesman said.    ""customs can do a good job when given the tools, but whenits hands are tied, it doesnt have the authority to demandform o (documents tracking merchandise from source todestination),"" he said.    many see it as a true test of whether producers andimporters will abide by the quota system.    ""it is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in thequota agreement,"" said one major u.s. roaster.     ""last time we had a gentlemans agreement, the trade didnot act as a gentleman,"" said another analyst adding, ""withoutthe need to submit documents, the ball will be in theproducers hands.""    some feel that importers will take advantage of thevoluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-membercountries at discounts and then bring it into the u.s. falselylabelled.    according to customs officials, several green coffeeimporters confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffeefraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navybeans.    ""if theres that much of a discrepancy between prices forone country and another, producers may be teted to get rid oftheir stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and bycircumventing the quota provisions,"" said paine webber analystbernie savaiko.    still, others believe that producers will not be hardpressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation inthe u.s. in the near term.

""theres going to have to be some acknowledgement that thedollar is going to be allowed to slip,"" said richard jeffrey ofhoare govett. ""if not, there is going to be continued fear thatwhen pressure emerges on the dollar, the fed will be forced totighten. this throws up the economic abyss of recession in theu.s. with obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.""    but some economists added that wall streets crash, whichdragged other major markets down with it, may help curb thevery problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflationfears and the massive and persistent u.s. trade deficits.    ""if there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in wall street...its some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,"" saidgeoffrey dennis of brokers james capel, echoing comments fromother london and tokyo analysts.    lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears offurther falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationarypressures and import demand in the u.s., they say.    such considerations may be helping bond markets resist theequity crash, according to mike osborne of kleinwort grieveson.    ""it would be suicidal for any government in the context ofwhat happened in the last couple of days to jack up theirinterest rates,"" he added.    stocks surged after news chemical bank cut its primelending rate half a point to 9.25 pct tuesday and u.s. fedchairman alan greenspan pledged support for the financialsystem.    the news eroded the most immediate fears that the stockcollapse would spill over into the economy, via a bankingcrisis for example, thus precipitating recession.    it also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of1.8200 marks from a european low of 1.7880. but economists saidtodays whiplash moves do not have long term significance andthat markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals inmind.    ""the united states has been able to live on borrowed time.if the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economicgrowth not recession...it contains good news (and) provides amore realistic assessment of the u.s. economy,"" said capelsdennis. but he added that markets are still very much indanger.

""the monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long assterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,""said kevin boakes, chief u.k. economist at greenwell montagugilt edged. boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow moneymeasure m0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from augusts 4.5 pctgrowth, which he said must cause some concern at the treasury.    but ""the fact that overall broad money growth has sloweddown is a rather encouraging sign,"" noted paul temperton, u.k.economist with merrill lynch capital markets. he pointed to afall in the year-on-year growth rate of the m3 broad moneyaggregate to 19.5 pct in september from augusts 22 pct.    it was concern about credit growth which prompted the bankof england to engineer a one point rise in u.k. bank base ratesto 10 pct in early august, caution endorsed subsequently bynews of a massive 4.9 billion stg july rise in bank lending.    temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry inthat period had been the behaviour of u.k. asset markets.    housing and equities were the key two asset markets ininfluencing consumer behaviour, he said.    in the light of the precipitous falls on u.k. equitymarkets in the past few days, ""there will almost certainly be astraightforward impact on consumer spending and on retailsales,"" temperton said.    ""almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth inconsumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,"" he added.    ""i think the stock market has decided that the bank lendingfigure is a thing of the past...we are talking about a veryserious panic and a flight to quality,"" spencer said.    a u.k. treasury official said that it was important to lookat all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowlythan bank lending.    senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lendingwas evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavypersonal sector borrowing.    figures from the banking information service showedpersonal sector lending by u.k. clearing banks rose by 1.66billion stg in september after a 978 mln stg august rise. muchof the rise reflected quarterly interest payments. reuter"

""these subsidies are blatantly unfair and are gatt illegal,since they were established after the zero soybean duty wasestablished in 1962,"" he said.    the asas unfair trade petition against the ec would askfor an investigation and modification of ec oilseed policies tomake the regime non-discriminatory.    the ec in 1962 ruled all ec oilseed imports duty-free, inan effort to fill its oilseed needs. but ec oilseeds productionhas risen dramatically since then.    the ec now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above worldmarket levels and is considering implementing a controversialoils and fats tax.    the subsidies ""are obvious attempts to circumvent the zeroduty binding and that makes u.s. farmers mad as hell,"" adamssaid.    the asa is confident the u.s. congress will support itstrade complaint, adams said. the asa also strongly opposes anec proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in theec, which will be considered by the ec commission in december.    u.s. soybean world market share has declined 35 pct involume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result ofec policies, adams added.    lord plumb, european parliament president and a speaker atthe conference, said the ec expanded oilseed production in 1973when the u.s. halted overseas sales of soy products. reuter"

""we will consider its relation to the punta del estedeclaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,""the u.s. ambassador said.    the u.s. can say no to the ec proposal if the ec ignoresthe u.s. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.    the key difference between the two approaches is that theu.s. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the ec is pushingonly for a reduction in farm suppports, samuels said.    if the ec farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,there would be little incentive for the community to work tocorrect the international trade situation, he added.    samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the ecoilseeds regime and an ec regulation concerning meat imports tothird countries as three crucial barriers to trade which theu.s. wants to see resolved under the auspices of gatt. reuter"

""its round one to the americans, "" said richard reid,senior european economist for brokers ubs/philips and drew inlondon.    but reid added, ""we shouldnt forget that it has taken oneof the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the westgermans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05percentage point.""    over the weekend, criticism by baker of earlier tighteningof west german monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall andfuelled speculation that the louvre accord was no longer valid.    six leading industrial nations agreed under februaryslouvre accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetarypolicies. it has since been reaffirmed by the group of seven -the us, japan, west germany, britain, france, italy and canada.    the frankfurt meeting on monday soothed currency marketsand the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours tradingin new york. at the frankfurt fixing on tuesday, the dollar wasquoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on monday.    guenther aschoff, chief economist at deutschegenossenschaftbank in frankfurt said massive declines on worldstock markets had been the main reason for the fall in westgerman short-term interest rates on tuesday.    ""the bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock marketlosses... that was the responsible thing to do and if it fitswith bakers wishes, then all the better,"" he said.    no central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and thebundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following risesin the u.s., aschoff said.    poehl told a conference in frankfurt on tuesday the centralbank has no interest in higher capital market rates and hethought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.    giles keating, economist with credit suisse first bostonltd in london said ""the cautious bundesbank has beaten a retreatand baker has won a battle...but he hasnt won the war as thesecurity repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it wasbefore the imf meeting last month in washington.""    before the imf meeting, when the louvre accord wasreaffirmed, the bundesbank was offering money market liquidityat 3.60 pct, keating noted.    economists said the united states now appeared to haveagreed to play by the rules of the louvre accord and supportthe dollar in return for the german action on interest rates.    any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinderwashingtons efforts to reduce its trade deficit, stoltenbergtold a news conference on tuesday. he added he would not ruleout central banks of leading industrial countries interveningon exchange markets to defend the dollars value.    deutsche genossenschaftbanks aschoff stressed westgermanys heavy dependence on exports and the need for currencystability. in addition, both the u.s. and west german centralbanks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force themto again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar. reuter"

""it simply demonstrated the united states will take militaryaction when they (iran) take military action,"" norman polmar, adefense analyst and author, said.    he said hitting the platforms had spared iran theembarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoidingan escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.    in addition, it minimized the risk to u.s. forces and thepotential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft thatcould have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.    anthony cordesman, author of a new book on the iran-iraqwar, said the united states apparently chose a limited targetto keep alive the possibility that u.n. secretary generaljavier perez de cuellar might still persuade iran to accept asecurity council call for a ceasefire.

"['money-fx', 'interest']",20764,test,yes,treasury's baker under fire for wall street drop,"as official washington sought torestore investor confidence after mondays wall streetcollapse, treasury secretary james baker came under fire fromcritics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.    bakers weekend blast at the west german bundesbank forboosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of aninternational accord to stabilize currency values.    nigel lawson, british chancellor of the exchequer, wasamong those who said the treasury secretarys statements helpedspur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investorsthink that a clash between the two major economic powers woulddamage the world economy.    lawson told a london television interviewer tuesday, ""ithink the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. that, ithink, was partly due to statements that have been made bysenior figures on the other side of the atlantic."" it was adispute that should never have happened, he added.    although baker appeared to patch over the rift at ahastily-called meeting with west german officials monday, he  still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the unitedstates on tuesday. baker cut short a long-planned trip toscandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.    said one u.s. analyst of bakers weekend remarks, ""histiming could not have been worse.""    one government bond salesman in new york said, ""he actuallythought that yelling at the germans, and threatening to smackthe dollar down would work. that doesnt show muchunderstanding of international monetary gamesmanship.""    however, some analysts said west germanys stubborn marchtoward higher interest rates may have forced bakers hand.    ""on the surface baker may look responsible for this, but ifyou go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financialmarkets), it was west german policy,"" said robert brusca ofnikko securities international in new york.    ""all mr. baker did was to mention the obvious in public, somaking him responsible for it was a little like killing themessenger,"" he said.    after mondays talks, the u.s. and west german governmentsmade it clear that the louvre currency accord, pieced togetherin paris in february, was still in effect.    wall street feared that collapse of the agreement might bea prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar tothe late 1970s. analysts believe mondays wall street crashwiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.   treasury sources said that baker, already unhappy aboutbonns refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep theglobal recovery moving, was angered by a bundesbank interestrate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.    he felt that the u.s. recovery, inching along in its 59thmonth, could no longer be the only engine of global economicexpansion. a growing u.s. economy has been serving as a hugemarket for debtor country exports.    moreover, baker, the consummate politician, was worriedthat the republican party might face next years presidentialelection with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badlytarnished.    a rise in global interest rates might worsen the debtcrisis and completely choke off u.s. economic growth that hasalready slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.    ""theres no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on theeconomy, and its important that the psychology turn aroundquickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, andeventually therell be a serious price to pay economically,""former deputy treasury secretary richard darman said in atelevision interview.    in many ways, the official response was mild.    washington was stunned by the sudden wall street retreat,with president reagan speaking for most people by admittingthat he was ""puzzled.""    u.s. government sources said the secretary immediatelyreturned to the treasury to be briefed on market developmentsand, presumably, their political impact.    for all of this, it seems unlikely that bakers status inwashington will diminish because of the market fall.    asked by reporters if somebodys head should roll becauseof the wall street retreat, texas democratic senator lloydbentsen said with some irony, ""oh, i think its much too late tobe doing that...you have an administration thats taken theattitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---retire to the living room to take a nap. you just cant dothat."" reuter"

""they (the bundesbank) just dont want to come too muchunder american fire,"" said chris zwermann, currency adviser atswiss bank corp here.    ""it seems to me that this is the bundesbank beating quite asignificant retreat from its position,"" added giles keating,economist at credit suisse first boston ltd in london.    the significance that retreat will emerge from the terms ofthe bundesbanks next tender for a securities repurchase pacton tuesday, and its result on wednesday, money marketeconomists said.    todays injection of liquidity shows that the bundesbankdoes not want a further strong rise in the tender allocationrate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.    the bundesbank and finance ministry had given no indicationthat the meeting would take place, although the financeministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.    earlier on monday the finance ministry spokesman, asked tocomment on the apparent u.s.-german clash over the louvreaccord, went no further than quoting stoltenberg as saying heassumed monetary cooperation would continue.    the spokesman said he believed baker had already left westgermany for sweden on monday. this week he is also due to visitdenmark and belgium. reuter"

""tit-for-tat"" policy that gave iran the initiative, saidharlan ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with csis.    he said with this appraoch america would suffer ""the deathof one thousand cuts.""    but for the united states to grab the initiativemilitarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining iransharbors or blockading the mouth of the gulf through which itsshipping must pass, schuler said.    he was among those advocating mining as a means of bringingiran to the neogtiating table. if vital supplies were cut off,tehran could not continue the war with iraq.    ullman said washington should join moscow in a diplomaticinitiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose anarms embargo against tehran if it refused to negotiate.    he said the united states should also threaten to mine andblockade iran if it continued fighting and must press iraq toacknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of asettlement.    iranian and western diplomats say iraq started the war byinvading irans territory in 1980. iraq blames iran for theoutbreak of hostilities, which have entailed world war i-styleinfantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.    each side has attacked the others shipping. reuter"

""we consider the matter closed,"" he said, a signal the u.s.administration did not want the gulf crisis to escalate.    iran had warned the united states earlier in the dayagainst exacerbating the gulf crisis, saying military actionwould endanger american interests.    following the raid, a okesman for tehrans warinformation headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a""crushing blow.""    ""the united states has entered a swamp from which it can inno way get out safely,"" tehran radio quoted him as saying.    diplomats noted, however, iran was also seeking to avoidostracism by arab states due to meet at a summit in amman onnovember 8 and discuss the iran-iraq war.    iranian prime minister mir-hossein mousavi is currently indamascus, and diplomats said he would seek syrian help inpreventing a total arab breach with tehran.    further escalation of the war threatening the gulf arabstates could work against tehran at the amman gathering, theysaid.

""the u.s. has thought carefully about what would correspondto iranian agression. they have proved to the iranians that anyfurther action will be met with a like-for-like response.todays action by the u.s. was not escalatory,"" pyne said.    kleinwort grievesons lambert said the u.s. strike was ""aresponsible retaliation,"" with the u.s. apparently indicating toiran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf iranchose to raise the level of conflict.    chase manhattans nicol took a different view, however.    he said he was unable to see what the u.s. had achieved asarab states such as kuwait and saudi arabia, whose intereststhe u.s. is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as aresult of the u.s. attack and fear some sort of iranianretaliation.    the initial upward market move this morning reflected astrong speculative reaction to rumours of a u.s. attack whichwas thought at one stage to have been against iranian missilelaunchers on the faw peninsula, close to kuwait, analysts said.    the later downtrend followed confirmation of a u.s. navyattack on an iranian oil platform by the u.s. defence secretarycaspar weinburger.    market operators were able to evaluate the situation in thegulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it lessserious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,analysts and traders said. reuter"

""thats not in keeping with the spirit of whatwe agreed to as recently as earlier this month in washington,""baker said in a u.s. television interview on sunday. he wasreferring to the meetings of finance ministers from the groupof seven (g7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed thepact.    under the louvre accord west germany and japan, who bothhave large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economicgrowth to take in more exports from the u.s., while the u.s.agreed to stop talking the dollar down.    however, baker said on saturday that while the louvreagreement was still operative, the west german interest ratemove would force the u.s. to re-examine the accord.

""exports in october could be relatively modest due to manypublic holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus willbe well over nine billion dollars, close to ten,"" yonhap said.    the sharp rise in the september surplus came from aresumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previousmonth.    more than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers,electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrestbetween july and september.    the south korean government originally targeted a fivebillion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raisethis to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half exportboom.    if confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplusseemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the unitedstates which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit withseoul last year, government economists said.    the u.s. government, trying to stem protectionist pressureat home, has called on south korea to open more markets toamerican goods and revalue the won faster.    the won was fixed at 804.90 against the dollar on monday,representing a 7.01 pct gain so far this year. reuter"

""saudiis a reliable supplier in that sense,"" said one trader.    japan imports about 50 pct of its lpg from saudi arabia.    no single nation could substitute for saudi arabia as anlpg supply source to japan, the sources said.    ""saudi arabia has committed itself to japanese lpg buyers,which has quelled fears that lpg supplies from the mideast gulfcould easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilitiesin that area,"" said another trader.    saudi arabia cut lpg shipments to japan and elsewhere by 20pct in september after a fire put a major gas plant atal-juaimah out of operation. october shipments were back tocontractual volumes as saudi was able to boost exports fromother ports.    attacks on gulf shipping by iran and iraq centered on cruderather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of lpgsupply disruptions, traders said.    they said an iranian blockade of the strait of hormuz wasunlikely because it would block irans oil shipments.    industry sources said japans lpg imports will not greatlyrise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at amoderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.    japanese term buyers of saudi lpg are expected to liftslightly lower volumes from january 1987, when imports fromindonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.    the customers are unlikely to slash saudi term purchases inlarge scale when japan increases annual imports of indonesianlpg to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in theyear ended march 1987, the sources said.    but when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase downterm purchases of saudi lpg and secure lower-priced cargoes onthe spot market, they said.    japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of lpg a year, of which5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by saudi arabia, 3.3 mln under termcontracts and two mln through spot purchases. some 80 pct ofjapans lpg imports are from the middle east.    saudi arabias state owned oil company petromin has madesome concessions on term prices to japanese customers in therecent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely thejapanese will accept the offer, the sources said.    the japanese term customers, however, have so far beenunsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula toreplace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.    japanese buyers pay saudi arabia a price notified bypetromin each month. most recently the fob price was set at 87pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (gsp)of arabian light.    buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftingsshould the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of arabianlights gsp.    petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the95 pct for contracts with japanese customers from next january,the trade sources said.    petromin also suggested that a sellers option of supplyingup to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject toseller-buyer agreement.    under the present contract, petromin can automatically cutsupplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.    ""if you want to import lpg from saudi arabia on a profitablebasis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct,"" saidan official at a major importer. ""freight costs are higher forcargoes coming from the gulf than southeast asia due to alonger haul and war risk insurance payments.""    japanese customers will visit saudi arabia this month tofinalise their separate contract talks, now focusing oncontractual period and volume, which could be very similar tocurrent levels, the sources said. ""when we talk business, wewould seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability ofhigh dependence on a single supplier,"" said one. reuter"

""the obvious lack of coordination between the bundesbank andfinance ministry does not instil confidence in foreigninvestors,"" said one economist for a london broker, who askednot to be identified.    bankers here expressed confidence the two top financialpolicy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship tosteer the economy through a particularly difficult time.    ""there are plenty of objective pressures which will resultin things getting back to normal again after a period of illfeeling,"" said commerzbank ag chief economist juergen pfister.    news on october 9 that the government was planning a 10 pctwithholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds ina market already reeling from rising interest rates at home andabroad.    bankers said the bundesbank was angered by the way thefinance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting thebundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflictingdetails to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.    both poehl, 57, and stoltenberg, 59, have been underextraordinary pressures lately.    poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by hisdeputy, helmut schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fightinflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he hadpursued so far this year to promote currency stability.    in recent statements poehl has sounded more likeschlesinger. for years the softly-spoken economist has beenwarning in speech after speech that excessive money supplygrowth would eventually lead to rising prices.    schlesinger now has a majority of support in the bundesbankcouncil, and since late summer poehl has had to represent hisviews, bankers said.    ""poehl is in a minority in his own house,"" said commerzbankspfister.    ""poehl is in a dilemma. he must follow a policy that is notentirely his own,"" said another economist.    the dilemma is that if german interest rates rise too far,they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the markand hurting west german exporters.    the dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since thebundesbanks new tack became clear in early october.    since last thursday, united states treasury secretary jamesbaker has criticized the bundesbank rate increases.    bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986war of words between the u.s. and west germany, in which u.s.officials talked down the dollar to force west germany tostimulate its economy and thus suck in more u.s. exports.    one way west germany agreed to do this was making a roundof tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.    but financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult forstoltenberg than he had bargained for.    the cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly votedmost popular government politician last year, had to faceresistance from local barons in the government coalitionparties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.    the withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising4.3 billion marks.    but it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it willpush up borrowing costs. the extra amount this costs thegovernment could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.    meanwhile stoltenberg is dealing with a local political rowwhich has turned into the countrys worst political scandal.    stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in washington lastmonth early to sort out a row in the northern state ofschleswig-holstein, where he heads the ruling cdu party.    the states cdu premier, uwe barschel, had to resign afterallegations of a ""dirty tricks"" election campaign led to heavylosses for the cdu in state elections.    barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in geneva lastweekend. police say the death appears to have been suicide.    cooperation between poehl and stoltenberg is all the moreremarkable as poehl is in the opposition social democrats, andwas appointed by former chancellor helmut schmidt.    when poehls contract came up for renewal earlier thisyear, chancellor helmut kohls cdu-led coalition governmentgave poehl another eight-year term.    werner chrobok, managing partner at bethmann bank, said hehoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.    but when poehl criticized stoltenbergs tax plans he wasnot only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating thebundesbanks independence of government, chrobok said. reuter"
