10344,dfl,"economic spotlight - dutch exchange rate policyrecent slackness on dutch capitalmarkets has led some bankers to question the central bankspolicy of pegging the guilder firmly to the west german markand to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy.    while agreeing with the banks commitment to defend theguilder strongly, some bankers want the bank to make more useof the range within which the guilder and the mark canfluctuate against each other in the european monetary system(ems).    roelof nelissen, chairman of amsterdam-rotterdam bank nv(amro) said the central banks policy was overcautious.    ""i would like to suggest that the bank use more freely therange given to the guilder in the ems,"" nelissen said at thepresentation of amros 1986 annual report last week.    within the ems, the mark is allowed to fluctuate againstthe guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100.    the central bank maintains a stricter policy and tries tokeep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. it regards astable exchange rate as its main target, using interest ratepolicies to influence the exchange rate.    the preference of exchange rate goals above interest rateaims goes almost undisputed in the netherlands.    critics say the bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short.    rabobank nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: ""bymaintaining the 113.00 limit, the central bank raises theexpectation it will always intervene above that level. if itsuddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard toobtain.""    amros nelissen said relatively small changes in interestrates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows ofsecurities business and sharp fluctuations on the dutch capitalmarket. large interest rate changes were often needed to bringabout small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, headded.    unlike amro, algemene bank nederland nv (abn) says this isa price the dutch have to pay. it fully agrees with the centralbanks policy, director-general julien geertsema told reuters,noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully withthe mark in the ems hurt confidence in the dutch currency.    ""it is a pity we need such a wide interest rate differencebetween west germany to maintain the exchange rate,"" he added.    interest rate differentials between west germany and thenetherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flowsbetween the two countries, as the economic performance of thetwo does not differ much, economists said.    data on 1986 capital flows between west germany and thenetherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 theyaccounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the twocountries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by thedutch-german chamber of commerce earlier this month.    economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interestand exchange rates.    west germany is the netherlands largest single tradingpartner, taking 28 pct of dutch exports and providing 26 pct ofimports in the last quarter of 1986, central bureau ofstatistics figures show.    at the moment, the rates for three month euromark depositstrade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have arate of around 5-7/16 pct.    amro bank argues that the dutch real interest rate willeven rise further because of expectations of deflation here in1987, contrasting with slight inflation in west germany.    in the netherlands, the cost of living is expected todecrease by 1.5 pct at a gnp growth rate of two pct, the dutchcentral planning agency said in its 1987 forecast last month.german gnp is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflationbetween zero and 1.0 pct, according to most german forecasts.    but despite this upward push on real dutch rates, moneydealers do not expect the central bank to cut official ratesindependently without prior moves by the bundesbank.    following the west german interest rate cuts on january 22,the dutch central bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its creditsurcharge. most traders were surprised by this move as they hadexpected the bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said.    the bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impacton the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted.    while not entirely unsympathetic to critics of itspolicies, the central bank keeps its grip firm and the rangenarrow.    ""the european monetary system is not only a relationshipbetween the guilder and the mark. many times widening of themargin between the two would implicate we have to buy or selllarge amounts of a third currency,"" central bank vice-directorjan-hendrik du marchie sarvaas said.    ""if we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, themarkets would start to believe it was weak. we dont want that.we want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as themark,"" he said. reuter"

11000,stg,"paris meet agreed not to publish bands - lawsonu.k. chancellor of the exchequer nigellawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations inparis last month agreed not to publish any bands in connectionwith their pact to stabilise currencies.    questioned by a parliamentary select committee about whythe participating countries had not announced any bands, lawsonreplied, ""we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to.""when asked whether that meant an informal joint currency floatwith set ranges was arranged in paris, lawson said ""i do notwant to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as notto make it easy for"" speculation against the accord.    lawson said the paris accord presumed that individualcountries would take corrective action if their currency beganreacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors.    but if such movements were due to extraneous factors,lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aidthrough concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges.    ""it is clear that both germany and japan are havingdifficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rateappreciations and making their economies more domesticallyoriented, just as it is taking time for the united states tomake its own economy more export oriented,"" lawson said.    in his oral evidence to parliaments select treasurycommittee, lawson repeated that he was happy with the poundscurrent level, adding that ""it is an objective ... to try tokeep it around that level.""    he said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges hadchanged since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because thepound had weathered that period so successfully.

5412,peseta,"spain to relax exchange controlsthe bank of spain is relaxing exchangecontrols to help put spanish banks on an equal footing witheuropean community competitors by the 1993 deadline for theending of restrictions, a central bank spokesman said.    ""the measures to take effect by june were designed to liftrestrictions on foreign currency operations, in line withderegulation in the banking industry,"" he said in a telephoneinterview.    the spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controlshighlighted a broader package of reforms announced last friday.    the central bank said in a statement the measures includedincreased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provisionfor future pension fund obligations.    it said the measures were the latest steps to deregulatespains financial sector, a move triggered by entry into thecommunity last year.    spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, aprocess that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreignbanks to open branches.    since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market andthey now control about 15 pct of the systems lending assets.    residents in spain can now borrow freely in foreigncurrency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against aprevious ceiling of 750 mln pesetas.    the 750 mln peseta limit was set last march. between thatdate and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into thecountry on new foreign currency loans.    the central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billionpesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would begiven clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days.    spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreigncurrency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, byissuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper.    they can also employ these funds to invest in foreignissues, while before they had to be converted into deposits.    foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies,instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency.    the central bank has also lifted the restriction on theamount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limitedto three times a banks capital equity.    the latest deregulation measures were welcomed by mostbankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month whichimposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible pesetafunds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates.    the reserve requirement, which was already in place onnormal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreignspeculative capital which is entering the country andthreatening the governments money supply growth target.    a foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which nowaccount for about 30 pct of deposits, placed spanish banks at adisadvantage with european competitors.    the government reduced fixed asset investment requirementsto 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact ofinterest rate deregulation. ""the real problem is the freeing ofinterest rates,"" the banker said. ""this is going to take a bigbite out of profits.""    the ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paidon deposits of up to 180 days.    the chairman of one of spains leading banks said themeasure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits thisyear. reuter"
